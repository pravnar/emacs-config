"text")) "Honor, Freedom, and Honors") (content ((type . "html")) "The Faculty of Arts and Sciences last Tuesday discussed the proposal to adopt an honor code. The item was formally moved, so it could be voted at the next meeting.<br /><br />Several comments were offered to the effect that there would be something wrong with asking students to write the formulaic honor statement repeatedly. No decision has been taken as to how frequently the affirmation would have to be made, and that seems to me a problem with the legislation. As the <i><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/4/2/faculty-still-concerned-honor/\">Crimson</a></i>&nbsp;accurately quotes me as saying, there is a big difference between affirming one's commitment to academic integrity once at matriculation, or once a year, and reciting the commitment like a ritual prayer on each item of submitted academic work. (CS 20 students have to answer \"check in questions\" on the reading the night before every class. There are just three or four questions and they are multiple choice, click-click-click and you are done. Would they be expected to type out the honor pledge in addition?)<br /><br />I observed that it seemed to me unlikely that a defiant soul like Emerson would have ritually and uncomplainingly written out the honor pledge for four years. Wouldn't he and some of Harvard's other eminent nonconformists at some point have refused? What sanction would Harvard want to have visited on such young cranks, destined for greatness, for the perfectly logical sin of refusing to affirm their own honesty? I am trying to imagine Harvard's great logicians, Quine and Putnam and Sacks et al., explaining to their logic classes that yes, \"I am being honest\" is a self-refential, semantically challenged proposition, but it didn't matter, they had to keep saying something like that anyway, because the Faculty had voted to require it of them.<br /><br />Part of the rationale for the code is that we have a cheating problem, and schools with honor codes have less cheating. A literature review was offered in support of the latter thesis, but upon reading it, I am not convinced that it actually supports any such conclusion. (Alas, the literature review, like the draft honor code and implementing legislation, is confidential by the protocol of Faculty meetings, not to be shared with those who are not members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.)<br /><br />Even if it were true that reciting the pledge made people less likely to cheat, I wouldn't favor it. \"Why not, if it works?\" Because there are values more important than effectiveness. It might also work to lower the room temperature or to paint the walls pink, but academic integrity is not a matter of behavioral manipulation by tried and true methods of psychological trickery. If it were, we'd just hire an ad agency. And getting people to be honest at Harvard is not the objective anyway; we want to graduate honest people. When Harvard students become corporate executives or political leaders or professionals, there will be no one there to make them recite the pledge that reminded them to be honest while they were students. Integrity has to come from some deeper place in their beings.<br /><br />A requirement that students affirm the honor pledge, repeatedly, feels to me like an infringement of students' right to free speech, which includes not only the right to say what they wish but also not to say what they don't wish. &nbsp;Rather than training students to recite formulas, we should be educating them toward exactly the opposite frame of mind, to resist and challenge attempts to require them to say things.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I think the honor pledge is an attempt to find the solution to a problem under the lamppost that is easiest illuminated.<br /><br />Students cheat for a variety of reasons. But one important reason students cheat, especially in catastrophic cases like <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/\">Harvard's Gov 1310</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/3/13/dartmouth-drops-cheating-charges-pdartmouth-college/\">Dartmouth CS course</a> a few years ago, is that they feel they are being cheated. Students tend to work hard when they think the course is making an effort to teach well and to make fair demands on students; they cut corners when they think the demands on them are unfair, or they reason that lazy professors should expect little work in return. This is a version of Harvard sociologist Chris Winship's<a href=\"http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/cwinship/files/low_low.pdf\"> Low-Low Contract</a> between faculty and students: \"Faculty pretend to teach, students pretend to study, and as long as parents and others paying the bills are oblivious, everyone is happy.\" A major cheating scandal disrupts the oblivious compromise, but making students recite the honor pledge without changing faculty behavior isn't a solution to the real problem.<br /><br />Here is what I think is really going on, aside from those egregious examples of catastrophic failure. The Faculty, as a corporate body, honors students for basically only one thing: Grade Point Average. For honors a student requires a departmental recommendation in addition, especially for High and Highest Honors, but a large component of the basis for <i>those</i> recommendations is itself based on GPA. Of course, even to graduate without honors a student needs grades that are above a very low minimum. So grades are the coin of the realm, whether you are struggling to meet the minimum standard or vying to graduate <i>summa.</i><br /><br />We do nothing to control the currency. There has been no Faculty-wide discussion of grades in years. Instructors used to get information about overall grade distributions, but such information is no longer routinely distributed.<br /><br />The only person who ever asks about grades is <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/03/harvard-professor-raises-concerns-about-grade-inflation/McZHfRZ2RxpoP5Xvwged1N/story.html\">Professor Mansfield</a>, and he always couches his question as one about grade inflation, sometimes, in my <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2001/4/23/the-racial-theory-of-grade-inflation/\">opinion</a>, incorrectly.<br /><br />The result of the lack of effort at conversation, much less standardization, is that the grading practices of individual faculty members have drifted apart. The only people who realize that this is happening seem to be the students who go from one course to another and are surprised, at the end of the term, to discover that quite different standards have been applied. Sometimes students make life-altering decisions as a result of their very limited view of Harvard grading practices. Economics Professor Claudia Goldin recently discovered quite <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/catherine-rampell-women-should-embrace-the-bs-in-college-to-make-more-later/2014/03/10/1e15113a-a871-11e3-8d62-419db477a0e6_story.html\">stunning differences</a> between the way men and women respond to getting B's in introductory economics. If Econ gives a B for the level of work for which English or Computer Science gives an A–, the variability is important, regardless of the compression. (I have no idea whether that might be true, but we did decide a year ago to offer a SAT-UNSAT track through our introductory course.)<br /><br />I have thought about things that my own Computer Science colleagues might do without a College-wide reform movement. We could certainly talk to each other about our grading practices, and we have started to do that. A more radical step would be to stop basing our honors recommendations so much on GPA. We might, for example, collectively examine and discuss students' programs, and reward, quite subjectively, the programs that are ambitious and daring as well as meeting some more relaxed standard of achievement. This would have various problems -- there could be inconsistencies and biases, and students would still have to meet certain College-wide grading standards to actually receive honors, whatever the local faculty group might recommend. It might be unworkable and it might be unfair, but the alternative is not without its own problems. Carrying out GPA calculations to five decimal places to check against a numerical threshold, when the input data are so noisy, uncalibrated, and unreliable, ought to offend the sensibilities of any proper scholar.<br /><br />Students, to the extent they understand that they are playing a game (one course from each of 8 Gen Ed areas, so many for the concentration, grading standards all over the place, and your goal is to exceed GPA x in the concentration and GPA y overall, while relying on assumptions and gossip about the grading practices in individual courses), are likely to cut corners when they decide the rules of the game are meaningless and the objective is arbitrary but valuable. One way of cutting corners is to take the easiest courses. Another is to take the courses you already know the best, and from which you will therefore learn the least, because the only metric for which Harvard will reward you is the grade you receive. And another is to skim the edge of honest behavior and hope you won't get caught, especially in a course where the professor doesn't seem to care much about what students are doing.<br /><br />I wish we could go after the real problem rather than the symptoms. I don't look kindly on cheating and I wish there were less of it (though I don't really have the sense that there is a lot of it in my courses). But to say that we need to respond with an honor code to our cheating problem, rather than taking up some of the larger educational issues that lie behind it, is a mistake. It feels like the patient has cancer and we are treating the acne, because acne medicine is what we have available to us.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />") (link ((rel . "replies") (type .

"text")) "Is the Jig Up for the NCAA?") (content ((type . "html")) "Yesterday, a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the football players at Northwestern University are employees of the University and entitled to unionize and bargain with the University about their work conditions. As&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/sports/ncaafootball/a-victory-for-athletes-as-university-employees.html?hp\">William Rhoden</a> of the New York Times says, \"The jig is up.\"<br /><br />I have been teaching a freshman seminar about the curious notion of athletic amateurism. It's an un-American concept, in its origins and in its implications; there are things that seem sketchy when you get money for doing them, donating a kidney for example, but generally speaking Americans don't have any trouble with payments and prizes. Amateurism is actually a British concept, rooted in the social class separation between gentlemen and laborers. But as a condition on athletics it does not survive in England, or in the Olympic movement which once celebrated it -- only in American colleges.<br /><br />Whatever its origins, amateurism has been becoming increasingly unsustainable as a collective fiction as the sums of money in college sports have exploded. Contrary to common belief, few schools actually make a profit on their athletic programs, because expenses have exploded too. But the sums made by the profitable programs have tempted many others to try.<br /><br />To maximize their competitive strength, on which their revenues depend, the schools offering athletic scholarships have agreed to screw their athletes in various ways. For example, they offer only one-year athletic scholarships, so they don't have to bear the cost for four years if someone either chooses not to play or becomes physically unable to play -- or just turns out not to be as good as a someone admitted later on. If I recall correctly, the scholarship schools have collectively agreed not to allow any school to offer multiple-year scholarships, as that, however good for the student, would create too much of a competitive advantage for the schools that were able to absorb the incremental cost.<br /><br />The Ivy League, which offers no athletic scholarships, is free from that form of abuse. Having no athletic scholarships also keeps the coaches on better behavior, since dissatisfied players can walk away from their teams without any financial penalty. It happens a lot, often not out of dissatisfaction but just because other opportunities become more interesting. One Harvard CS entrepreneur I have taught was a recruited athlete and never played a single game, having quit the team during the first week of practice.<br /><br />The NLRB regional director has concluded, reasonably enough, that players whose continued financial support is dependent on athletic performance are employees first and students second.<br /><br />This will be litigated, of course; the NCAA, which can afford very good lawyers, is not going to come crashing down on the say-so of one regional labor director. But I do think the jig is up. Between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Bannon_v._NCAA\">Ed O'Bannon</a> case, and some persistent, high-profile journalism that is laying bare the NCAA's hypocrisy, some things are going to have to change.<br /><br />In fact, the remarkable thing to me is that the NCAA, which has been so successful in turning football and men's basketball into a national entertainment empire, could not have seen this coming and made some limited changes to their most ethically indefensible policies. They must have calculated that there was no reason to increase their costs until they were forced to. So much for the student-athlete fiction. And now they may not get away with offering decent protections against the financial consequences of injuries and whatnot; the big time schools may have to pay their athletes, which could get very very complicated -- since whatever other ripples that step might have, it could surely not happen without paying women athletes as well as men.")

"html")) "About nine months ago, at the time of the initial Snowden revelations, I took out my trusty #2 pencil and did a quick and dirty calculation of how much it would cost to record every phone conversation made in America. Here is what I wrote in a <a href=\"http://harry-lewis.blogspot.hk/2013/06/who-cares-about-prism.html\">blog post</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee; color: #222222; line-height: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">With so much about the surveillance system still undisclosed, I wonder if the following could be true. … it would be very cheap to record and store all US telephone calls. Audio is highly compressible; a back of the envelope calculation suggests the government could store a&nbsp;whole year's telephone calls -- all of them -- for a small number of millions of dollars, given the low cost of massive storage units. What is preventing the government from doing that is, presumably, wiretap law. Could the calls be lawfully be recorded by the government, but listened to only after issuance of an appropriate court order? Could the recordings be made by the telcos and held in dead storage, but turned over to the government in response to a narrow and specific court order?</span></span></blockquote>&nbsp;If you are surprised to think it would be technically and economically feasible to record everything, every word of every call for an entire year, just think of how many hours of audio you can carry around on your iPod. And storage technology keeps getting denser while the number of minutes of phone calls is probably going up very slowly if at all.<br /><br />Well, it turns out, courtesy of more Snowden documents, that the NSA is doing exactly what I speculated, though not, as far as we know, for calls within the US. Some lucky country--the <i><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-surveillance-program-reaches-into-the-past-to-retrieve-replay-phone-calls/2014/03/18/226d2646-ade9-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html\">Washington Post </a></i>is cooperating with the US government by not telling us which one--is having every single telephone call captured, not the \"metadata\" but the actual audio, every minute of it. The recordings are stored for later review, which requires no judicial authority. <strike>That means if you are an American and you call granny in the lucky country, the NSA has the call on record and needs no authorization to listen to what you two were chatting about.</strike>&nbsp;(Added 3/24: Calls involving US citizens are subject to separate protections.)<br /><br />The NSA's comment is predictable: We wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't lawful and important. Problem is, the NSA doesn't have to do the risk-reward calculation. Based on the ever-shrinking number of terrorism plots said to have been prevented by the bulk metadata collection program, there is good reason to be skeptical about claims that the rewards are substantial. And what are the costs when something like this comes to light? Already the EU, furious about US surveillance of Europeans, has <a href=\"http://epic.org/2014/03/european-parliament-suspend-sa.html\">voted</a> to suspend the \"Safe Harbor\" provisions of European privacy laws -- essentially a loophole that allowed US companies greater flexibility in the way they protect the privacy of data than European companies enjoy. What will be the cost, in cold hard dollars, if American companies lose European business over this, or are forced to spend what it takes to come into compliance with European standards?<br /><br /><br />") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Beijing, and South Carolina") (content ((type . "html")) "I write from Hong Kong, where I arrived last night (well, this morning to you at the antipodes) from Beijing. I gave two talks at the Beijing Institute of Technology, an enormous engineering school that has ambitions to be a top university in the liberal arts as well. I was surprised when I received the kind invitation from Professor Pang Haishao to learn that \"Liberal arts\" was even a concept on the mainland. In fact Professor Pang heads an institute for liberal education that unites the interests of faculty at several universities. I am grateful to the Institute for inviting me to speak and am honored to have had the opportunity to meet the Chairman of the Council, Guo Dacheng, and several other senior officials of BIT.<br /><br />Some of the challenges to liberal education in China are the expected ones and would be familiar to any American academic who has participated in a general education program that cuts across all disciplines. For example there is the competition for curricular time with specialized subjects; students demand to know \"what will learning this get me?\" I admire Prof. Pang and her colleagues who are pressing the case that liberal education is good for the soul, and actually makes for a more creative educated class.<br /><br />In my talk I hit hard on the key <a href=\"http://www.generaleducation.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k37826&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup87208\">phrase</a> in Harvard's Gen Ed masthead, of education conducted \"in a spirit of free inquiry.\" I pressed the need for universities to be the places in society where everything can be questioned, where nothing is ever finally settled. I noted the dichotomy in Harvard's statement about the goals of general education, between cultivating traditions and preparing students for a changing world. And I stressed the importance of universities as the places where ethical leaders are educated.<br /><br />The money quote I used to explain General Education came from an unexpected direction. When some Harvard Hollywood types were up for prizes recently, the <i>Globe</i>&nbsp;ran a <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/03/02/oscar-close-for-harvard-trained-documentary-filmmakers/bgshwWDFwaQEuohX5qsHQL/story.html\">story</a> with this piece of wisdom from a colleague in the department of Visual and Environmental Studies:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Alfred Guzzetti, a filmmaker and VES professor, describes that philosophy in straightforward terms.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">“If you want professional training, do it after college,” said Guzzetti.  “In college, try to learn about the world.”&nbsp;</blockquote>The reaction was very positive, and I got some touching notes from young faculty, some referring to specifically to the Guzzetti quote. I signed about ten copies of <i>Excellence Without a Soul,</i>&nbsp;and that astonished me. These were copies of the second Chinese printing, which I had not seen -- it has a different and cheerier cover than the first. One person told me she had tried to get a copy of the English language original but it was confiscated at customs! I have a vision of a naughty customs official reading it by flashlight in some secluded hideaway.<br /><br />As I talked to more people about the book, I began to understand that its appeal was only partly due to whatever meager eloquence I might have brought to the argument for liberal education. Professors liked it just as much for what it said about the possibility in America, and in an American university in particular, of defying authority and getting away with it.<br /><br />So I am glad I hit the issue of free speech very hard, and the inextricable intertwining of academic freedom and freedom of speech. In one slide I posted ex-NYU-President Sexton's avowal that you could have academic freedom without full free speech rights, and said I doubted that was true, so ventures like NYU-Shanghai and Yale-NUS were inauthentic lookalikes of liberal institutions. I observed that America had never had a Lysenko, and that the courts were backing the rights of climate scientists and evolutionary scientists against the appalling political interference to which they were sometimes subjected.<br /><br />I stumbled in at least one place, where I wish I had explained myself better. I talked about universities having a role in promoting civic engagement, which is the fourth of the listed purposes of Harvard's Gen Ed program. One questioner asked point blank whether that meant that Gen Ed was a vehicle for promoting political correctness. I realized only afterwards where that question was coming from -- the difference between propaganda and promotion of civic virtue is far from obvious when \"harmony\" is a matter of law. I had already spent some time on the First Amendment and the fact that mistrust of government is itself a fundamental civic ideal in the U.S. The audience seemed to particularly enjoy my images of political cartoons of American presidents, from <a href=\"http://vicepresidents.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TJ.jpg\">Jefferson</a> as a cock to his hen Sally Hemmings, to both George W. Bush and Barack Obama as monkeys.<br /><br />So overall it was an inspiring visit, not only for what it taught me about the aspirations of Chinese academics but for what it reminded me about how lucky I am to be a professor where I am, in a country that puts academic speech out of range of government censors and propagandists.<br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Then I woke up in Hong Kong and <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/s-c-senate-is-urged-to-reject-penalties-for-colleges-over-gay-themed-books/74521?cid=pm&amp;utm_source=pm&amp;utm_medium=en\">read</a> about the government of South Carolina.</span><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 24px;\">This month the House&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/s-c-house-keeps-penalties-on-colleges-that-assigned-gay-themed-books/74099\" style=\"background-color: white; background-position: 0px 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #007aad; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: none;\">moved to strip</a><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 24px;\">&nbsp;the College of Charleston of $52,000 in the state budget and the University of South Carolina-Upstate of about $17,000, citing concerns that the reading assignments were out of line with taxpayers’ values.&nbsp;</span></span></blockquote>So there we are. The legislature thinks it is just promoting civic virtue by punishing a university for assigning a couple of books that talk about gay issues. Maybe we don't have so much to be proud of after all, if legislators are so easily confused about the meaning of speech, debate, discussion, and argument. It's like we were back in the McCarthy era, when academics and schoolteachers got punished for having students read <i>The Communist Manifesto.</i><br /><br />A word to American academics of all disciplines: There is no possibility that we could talk too much about the importance of free speech. Lose that and we lose everything. Defend that and we give hope to the world.") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href .

"text")) "All Hail Coach Kathy") (content ((type . "html")) "The Harvard basketball news has been dominated by the men's team winning the Ivy League outright by beating Yale Friday night, in New Haven. The Ivy season is a double round robin tournament, with every team playing every other, once at home and once away. All the games are on Fridays and Saturday, no mid-week travel during term time. There is no postseason tournament to get into the NCAA March Madness, and that is why Harvard was the first team into the brackets.<br /><br />Harvard's team is pretty unusual by national standards. I was swapping sports talk with a friend at a big state university and mentioned that one of my CS students, Laurent Rivard, was on the starting five -- and another, Steve Mondou-Missi, is an Applied Math major. He thought I was making it up.<br /><br />Harvard's success under the estimable Coach Amaker has gotten a lot of attention, but I am glad that our women's coach, Kathy Delaney-Smith, has gotten due recognition. The Globe had a lovely <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/03/04/harvard-kathy-delaney-smith-top-ivy-league/Byt5jaVY484q3TdjEPlMbL/story.html\">tribute</a> last week in anticipation of her 515th win, which would make her the winningest coach in Ivy League history. That victory came Friday night, as the women's team was beating Yale at Harvard at the same time as the men's team was clinching the Ivy championship in New Haven.<br /><br />Coach Delaney-Smith is a complete anomaly in today's collegiate sports world. She has coached at Harvard for 32 seasons, and never coached at any other college. Harvard hired her from a local high school, where she had picked up basketball coaching as an add-on to what started out as a job coaching the swim team. She hadn't even played the five-on-five game herself. When she came to Harvard she stepped into the shoes of no giant, inherited no grand recruiting tradition. She achieved her successes by hard work, study, and personal magnetism.<br /><br />Coach Delaney-Smith must have had a million opportunities to jump to other schools. Her teams have won 11 Ivy championships. One of the most exciting moments of my years as dean came in 1998, when she took one of those championship teams to the NCAA tournament and, seeded 16 in their bracket, knocked off #1 Stanford. Only time it's ever happened in either the men's or women's game.<br /><br />What makes the Globe profile so good is that it emphasizes Delaney-Smith's relation to her players, and how those relations persist. I've heard it from her alums, and she describes it exactly the same way they do.<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">“I love Ivy League titles,” she said. “I love the banners in my gym, and I’m very proud of them. But more important than that for me is my athletes, my alumni, their experience. I’m really in it for my student-athletes, not for my records. I want them to grow, I want them to be rewarded.</span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">“I love when my alumni come back and talk about and share their experiences with each other and with me about how important being part of the Harvard basketball program was to them and their lives.”</span></blockquote>Yup. That is the person I know. I wish we saw that spirit in the faculty more often than I do. I've always found it telling that the advertisements for coaches' jobs at Harvard talks about those values, of the importance of mentoring and developing the character of students during their formative years. I've been on search committees for coaches, and there is as much talk about character as there is about Xs and Os.<br /><br />No ad I've seen for a faculty position mentions the developmental role of the professor. No faculty hiring committee would discuss such things, at least not for long. Nor does the incentive and reward system for faculty take much account of whether a professor has such relationships with students. The students who have anyone like Delaney-Smith in their Harvard lives are very, very fortunate.<br /><br />Congratulations, Coach. Way to go. You are the best.") (link ((rel . "replies") (type .

"html")) "After it came to light last year that the email of several of Harvard's resident deans had been read in an overreaction to something printed in the Crimson, the president appointed a committee to recommend policies on the privacy of electronic communications. That committee has now issued a fine <a href=\"http://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/ECPTF_Final_Report_2_25_14_b.pdf\">report</a>. It doesn't cover every base--it doesn't explain the status of searches of post.harvard.edu email addresses for alumni, for example. (Those are not actual email accounts, just proxies for the alums' own off-campus email addresses. I don't know that anything sent to post.harvard addresses is stored at all, but in principle Harvard could access messages on the fly.) But it gets all the big ideas right, at least approximately.<br /><br />I won't repeat what I blogged last year (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fharry-lewis.blogspot.com%2F2013%2F03%2Femail-privacy-at-harvard.html&amp;ei=75AWU8XoIdHwkQe0-oCwCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPAhIymU5KuMrZsYgpzNDQraBXWw&amp;sig2=G0kBpO3nH1N-8Kns3kIrGg&amp;bvm=bv.62286460,d.eW0\">starting</a> just a year ago, on March 9, see also <a href=\"http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2013/04/email-privacy-update.html\">this</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fharry-lewis.blogspot.com%2F2013%2F09%2Femail-privacy-redux.html&amp;ei=75AWU8XoIdHwkQe0-oCwCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYbxTGBE7r5mZJr5Y5jLK24xCSsw&amp;sig2=YYdF8H_IteuksromeEEIpQ&amp;bvm=bv.62286460,d.eW0\">this</a>). The Barron Committee recommendations include a number of elements of the FAS Faculty email policy which, depending on your point of view, either existed or <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fharry-lewis.blogspot.com%2F2013%2F07%2Fthe-keating-report.html&amp;ei=8pEWU43HLY-kkQfbmoDAAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFc0ot7nYbEUHSZsx65AdzE-X1L7w&amp;sig2=AqkswNZeWyXAX3EqNUw33g&amp;bvm=bv.62286460,d.dmQ\">never did</a>. In particular, the notice requirement, which was in the FAS policy, is in the new policy, with only a little wiggle room. The would-be FAS policy language:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee; color: #222222; font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;\">i</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;\">n extraordinary circumstances such as legal proceedings and internal Harvard investigations, faculty records may be accessed and copied by the administration.</span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;\">Such review requires the approval of the Dean of the FAS and the Office of the General Counsel. The faculty member is entitled to prior written notice that his or her records will be reviewed, unless circumstances make prior notification impossible, in which case the faculty member will be notified at the earliest possible opportunity.</span></span></blockquote>(Authorization at the level of the dean of the faculty and the general counsel are also part of the proposal.) The Barron Committee language:<br />          <br /><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">   <div class=\"layoutArea\">    <div class=\"column\">     <blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt;\">When the University intends to access user electronic information, notice ordinarily should be given to that user. All reasonable efforts should be made to give notice at the time of access or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible.&nbsp;</span></blockquote>I consider this provision extremely important, as it provides the best gating mechanism. If you are going to have to explain yourself to the party being searched, you are probably going to use a pretty high standard before doing the search. The language is not unequivocal, but I am willing to grant that there may be edge cases I haven't thought of (aside from the obvious ones, separately treated in the committee report, of searches required by government agencies which prohibit notice to the individual being searched). The creation of an oversight body will also suppress the instinct to peek; another good proposal from the committee.<br /><br />In the Globe <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/03/09/harvard-university-administrators-secretly-searched-deans-email-accounts-hunting-for-media-leak/d5lYY8vXLyZQYWtTNGxWkL/story.html#sthash.A7ZKYC3k.dpuf\">story</a> that broke the news of the search, I observed, \"Why not tell them what was being done if it was really an OK thing to do?\" I drew some flak for that comment, which was my completely spontaneous and unfiltered reaction when the reporter told me what had happened. It always just seemed to me common courtesy, whatever the policy, and I am glad that what should all along have been good manners will likely become an official rule.<br />     </div></div></div>") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Does the Controversy Over the Student Government Funding Mean Anything?") (content ((type . "html")) "The student government at Harvard, known as the Undergraduate Council, has long been a weak organization. Seats go <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/18/uc-special-election-housing/\">uncontested</a>, and the last presidential election was won by a guy who pretty much made a <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/11/22/clark-mayopoulos-win-resign/\">joke</a> out of his campaign.<br /><br />Part of the reason is structural. Harvard has a strong collegiate staff, so some services that student governments provide at other universities are centrally provided here. That has always helped explain why the student government here gets less funding than it does elsewhere. I think part of the problem is also the general problem of diversity. Harvard students are interested in so many different things that it's hard to find a majority opinion on anything that matters. The endless controversies over the choice of bands for Springfest seem to me almost inevitable; there simply is no majority opinion on musical tastes.<br /><br />The UC is funded by a $75 term bill fee that is itemized so students can opt out of it. The opting-out requires the effort of sending a letter to the term bill office--not a major burden by any means, but enough of an annoyance that most students who are indifferent or hostile to the UC don't bother to hold back their financial support. (I think. There used to be very high compliance, don't truly know about now.)<br /><br />Over the past month there has been a somewhat puzzling series of Crimson stories about the UC's desire to get $250,000 more per year to expand its activities. The <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/20/pfister-supports-increased-funding/\">Dean</a> of the College and the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/20/uc-faust-additional-funding/\">President</a> have said sympathetic things but have observed that they are dealing with budget problems of their own. I paid little attention to this until I suddenly realized that I had been there, fifteen years ago, when the UC wanted to raise the fee from $20. I eventually decided that should happen, and I wrote an <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/11/29/raise-the-council-fee-pshould-the/\">op-ed for the Crimson</a> explaining my view. I think it went to $35 shortly thereafter, so the fee has already more than doubled since then.<br /><br />My general view has always been that extracurricular activities should be supported, at least the ones that students learn something from or that keep them healthy. (I have always been less sympathetic to the identity-politics groups.) Aside from whatever practical lessons such group activities teach about cooperation and leadership, and what intellectual or career-oriented skills they may foster, they on average tend to reduce drinking. Oh, I know all about the rugby team and the initiation rituals, but in general, I am persuaded that students who are busy doing something are less likely to spend their evenings wasted than students who have nothing to do but pass their courses.<br /><br />(And drinking is a problem; the freshman formal was shut down early a few weeks ago, and the Crimson has a long <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/20/drinking-games-party-smart/\">piece</a> about Harvard's bingeing culture.)<br /><br />Add to that, the fact that Harvard has apparently reduced its support of club sports to save money, so the UC has a reasonable argument that it needs to take up the slack. I'm not sure I like the vector there: to save money, one department reduces its services to students, so students ask for money to replace those services, except the student body itself controls how that money is allocated. The pirouette may leave students paying the same amount of money and the university losing control over its allocation, while proudly announcing that it has reduced its budget gap.<br /><br />But here is the part of the story that I don't get. \"Mayopoulos and Goffard, who hosted a rally in the Yard before their meeting with Faust, said that they discussed the additional funding’s importance with the president and how it might be acquired, either through a term bill increase or directly from the University.\" So they hold a rally, and then ask the president for a quarter of a million dollars. She says \"no\" to direct funding, and quite rightly directs them to Dean Pfister to talk about the term bill mechanism. But the UC doesn't stop here. \"Mayopoulos said that that Harvard 'should bear a significant amount of the cost of extracurriculars' on campus. 'If an increase in the term bill is necessary, this increase will be matched by the University so that students are not alone in this,' &nbsp;he said.\"<br /><br />Probably this is just the kind of low-grade populism for which the UC has always won scorn, and I should leave it alone. Still, it's embarrassing for the future leaders of the free world, and I worry that it's part of the infantilization process I have been observing for some time. It's one thing to ask for the student government to ask permission to raise the term bill fee. Every time such a request is granted, there is the potential for an instant plebiscite. If students don't want to turn over their money to the UC, they can opt out. Just as in any representative democracy, the expectation of the electorate for prudent spending of resources raised through taxation provides a counterweight to the ambitions of the political class to expand the central budget. It's a healthy tradeoff. It's so much easier, and less realistic, for the UC just to ask the university to turn over the money and trust them, rather than for the UC to ask the entire student body to trust them, one term bill payer at a time.<br /><br />Acting like a teenager asking for an allowance is so different from asking for authority to raise a voluntary tax on your constituents. Holding a rally over this, when there are real problems in the university and in the world worth rallying over, is childish. My goodness, what do our students think about the relevance to them of political persuasion and civic action? Isn't there a teachable moment here?<br /><br />") (link ((rel . "replies") (type .

"html")) "The <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/17/silence-policy-poetry-harvardX/\">Crimson</a> reported a few days ago that Harvard was now teaching a poetry course in which students were not allowed to ask questions for the first hour, so as not to interfere with the filming for the HarvardX version of the course. On reading that I had a momentary reaction, a vague sense that Harvard had crossed some educational Rubicon, and that sometime in the future someone would point to this little article as a hinge point in the history of higher education.<br /><br />But I pulled back, for a variety of reasons. There are lots of lecture courses in which students do not ask questions anyway. This professor was making a point of having a much livelier conversation with the undergraduates for half an hour after the recorded portion of the lecture, which is a lot more than I or many of my colleagues do. I do my own experiments in online instruction, through the Extension School, which makes video recordings of my lectures available to distance students, and while I don't discourage questions (and my mic doesn't pick up students' voices very well), I am conscious of small changes in my teaching style---there are certain kinds of jokes I will risk making in a class that is not recorded that I won't make when the lecture will wind up on the Internet. Reports are that the poetry course is fabulous, and the production values are very high; as an example of questionable pedagogy, many other courses would be better targets. And I may also have hesitated a bit because the professor is married to Larry Summers, and I was not confident that my judgment was impartial.<br /><br />So I let it go; maybe there is no Rubicon there. Maybe we crossed it years ago. Maybe this is just a streamlet and the big river crossing is yet to come. Or maybe there is no discontinuity at all, and the various instructional modes will all wind up complementing each other in the best possible way once a few experiments have been evaluated.<br /><br />But when Professor Mary Lewis (no relation) wrote in this morning's <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/21/letters-to-the-editor/\">Crimson</a>, \"surely the world’s best and brightest students don’t compete mightily to get into Harvard only to become mere backdrops to Harvard’s world stage,\" it sounded right, and I was glad she said it. She reminds me that my own <a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/09/reinventing-the-classroom\">decision</a> to start teaching a flipped-classroom course, rather than trying to go the MOOC route, was in part a reaction to my fear of MOOCification, and was driven by the rewards I get from hearing chatter in the classroom, from bantering with students, from seeing light bulbs lighting up over their heads. \"[W]e need a college-wide discussion,\" Professor Lewis goes on to say, \"of how to maintain our pedagogical values in the brave new world of online education.\" Amen.")

"text")) "When Not to Run a University Like a  Business") (content ((type . "html")) "A friend of mine recently explained over dinner with some friends that a university has to be run like a business, but not too much like a business. He's right, and the fiasco about Harvard misreporting employee earnings to the IRS is a perfect example.<div><br /></div><div>The <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/02/08/harvard-mistake-costs-employees/aqxqU6ntcyrgabVU7yBI9O/story.html\"><i>Globe</i></a> ran the story on February 8. The university had long made available a certain benefit to employees, which the IRS considered taxable. So the value of the benefit would show as income on employees' W-2 forms. So far, nothing unusual. Through some combination of changes in tax regulations and changes in the benefit program, the benefit ceased to be taxable in the eyes of the IRS in 2009. But Harvard, mistakenly, continued report its value as income on employees' W-2s. Unfortunate, and costly to employees, because they had to pay taxes on what should have been nontaxable benefits. And now they have to amend their returns, perhaps several years of returns, if they want to get their money back from Uncle Sam.</div><div><br /></div><div>So far this is a straight business story. The tax code is a labyrinth and it changes all the time, and somebody made a mistake. It was a kind of mistake that probably happens all the time in corporate America, though institutions that are trying to help their employees (or increase their competitiveness inhering and retention) by offering benefits may be more likely to make mistakes like this than organizations that offer the minimum. In any case, it's a shame, and somebody should get scolded for it, or worse--maybe not even someone within the University, could be an outside contractor or consultant on these technical matters. Just like in a normal business.</div><div><br /></div><div>The place where Harvard shouldn't have acted like a normal business but did is in how it handled the affected employees. Its initial response was to send a letter to affected employees on January 21, 2014 -- about three months after the error was discovered. I have not seen the letter, only the reaction it drew from Harvard Law School professors Alvin Warren and Daniel Halperin. Here is their characterization of Harvard's letter.</div><div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The letter misstates the law.&nbsp; It says that \"IRS regulations do not allow the University to assist you in filing for a state or federal income tax refund.\"&nbsp; There is no such regulation.</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The letter does not accurately present the scope of the problem.&nbsp; It says that \"For many people, the amount of the over-reported income was less that $200 per year.\"&nbsp; That is true, but for some employees, the amount exceeds $10,000.&nbsp; Nowhere is the total scope of the problem frankly presented.&nbsp; We were told in our meeting that more than 11,000 current and former employees are affected, with the total amount of overreported income exceeding $20,000,000.&nbsp; In our judgment, to mention in the letter only those employees for whom the amount involved is less than $200 per year is misleading as to the true extent of the problem.</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The letter fails to reveal all of the years for which there is a problem.&nbsp; The letter only discusses 2011-13, but the overreporting also occurred in 2009 and 2010.&nbsp; This fact is obscured by the vague expression in the first paragraph, which states that the problem involves \"several years prior to 2014.\"&nbsp; The full scope of the years involved is never disclosed.&nbsp; The federal statute of limitations has run for 2009, so no refund can be claimed for that year unless an employee's tax return is still open due to, for example, an audit.&nbsp; The federal statute of limitations for 2010 runs on April 15, 2014, but the administration does not believe it can provide corrected W-2 forms by then.</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Most grievously, the letter fails to accept Harvard's responsibility to make its employees whole for its monumental error.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although 11,000 Harvard employees were victims of the administration's error, the only remedy presented in the letter is for each of the victims to file amended tax returns with the state and federal governments.&nbsp; The only \"resources\" offered in the \"Frequently Asked Questions\" that accompanied the letter are a couple of links to federal (not state) government tax sites.&nbsp;</span></blockquote></div><div><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The professors say that Harvard should pay interest on the money the employees should have had and should underwrite the cost of filing amended returns.</span></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">To do anything less … would indicate that the central administration does not believe that it has an obligation to take responsibility for its errors.&nbsp; Nothing could be further from the core values of truth and honesty that infuse teaching and research at this University.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><div>The Globe reports that the University has agreed to do as the professors suggest, so things seem to be back on the right track.</div><div><br /></div><div>The question is, why did it take these professors yelling for Harvard to do the right thing? I suspect the answer is, because folks in the Central Administration were trying to run Harvard like a business. In a normal business, it would be pretty simple -- somebody \"checks with Legal,\" and \"Legal\" reports back what the business is required to do. Decisions get made on how they affect the bottom line and protect the company against risks. Human Resources gets a tip so they can be ready for whiny employees, but there really isn't much more they have to do beyond satisfying their legal requirements. Maybe someone suggests offering the affected employees some help with filing amended tax returns, but there's no budget for that, the quarter looks grim financially already, and Legal suggests that trying to help employees may be <i>creating</i>&nbsp;liability the company doesn't have. So the minimal letter goes out, the revised W-2s follow, and tough luck to anyone who doesn't like it. It's a free labor market, nobody has to work here, and everybody knows the amounts of money involved for any individual are not large enough to quit over.</div><div><br /></div><div>In this sense, running a university like a business doesn't work, either practically or ethically. It doesn't work practically because the whole university is a free speech zone -- and a free speech zone full of smart people who know a lot and are sometimes afflicted with idealism. Word gets around, people compare notes, and eventually someone blows the whistle. It sounds like that January 21 letter did not have a prayer of succeeding -- not when it went to 11,000 Harvard employees.</div><div><br /></div><div>And it doesn't work ethically either, because universities pride themselves &nbsp;in truth-telling, on treating people with respect and dignity, and so on. Our business product is the truth, and training in the art of the search for the truth. We teach lessons in everything we do every day, even in how we respond to incorrect W-2s. Our whole system is set up to ensure that educational and ethical values are pre-eminent. Our chief executive, for example, is a professor, not someone whose last job was being CEO of some other kind of business.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I understand how the business departments of the university can become isolated from its educational mission. We want accountants who are trained in accounting, not in French literature. They don't sit around all day talking about the larger mission of the university. Their instincts quite properly may have been to help Harvard be run like a business.</div><div><br /></div><div>But somewhere up the chain of command someone should have said, \"This would work at Pepsi-Cola, but it's neither right nor workable at Harvard.\" Indeed, since 11,000 people got these letters, there must have been lots of people in lots of command chains to whom that thought must have occurred. Somewhere a decision was made to do the wrong (if lawful) thing, and I'll bet it was because that was thought to be the way you run a business. However it happened in detail (I haven't a clue), I'll bet it in some larger sense it happened because of the corporatization of Harvard, the sublimation of educational and moral values to demands to meet short-term budget goals and minimize certain risks.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I am grateful to Professors Warren and Halperin for taking the time to explain the situation to the community, for going to the effort to sit down with University administrators and to get them to reconsider their original, shortsighted remedy. And I am grateful to Harvard for doing something it almost never does -- acknowledging, by its actions, that it made a mistake and needed to correct it.</div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type .

Dean Jay Harris presented it, and Melissa Franklin, Arthur Kleinman, and I commented briefly. <a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/02/harvard-college-honor-code\">Harvard Magazine</a> has a fuller account than the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/5/faculty-voice-few-opinions/#\">Crimson</a>. Professor Franklin asked the obvious question, given all the talk about this honor code being a way to bring students into partnership with the faculty rather than having the faculty act as their superiors. Why not expect the faculty to sign the honor code too?<br /><br />But the discussion was thin because the materials to discuss were thin. The honor board was off the table for now. Even the report laying out the case for an honor code was off the table. A draft had been available last year via authenticated login, but was never made public. As I recall it was discussed at one poorly attended \"town meeting,\"not even a regular faculty meeting. I am not even sure it was generally available to students, whose support for an honor code was cited in the faculty meeting. I conclude I was, for some reason, not supposed to refresh my memory about what it said. (I found it eventually on the web site of the Secretary of the Faculty; the draft report is dated March 26, 2013, but it's confidential. <a href=\"http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1238498.files//Honor%20Code%20Progress%20Statement%204.9.13.pdf\">Here it is</a>, for those authorized to see it.)<br /><br />Even what is likely to be the most sensitive question, whether students will be required to write out the mandated pledge on every piece of academic work they submit, was supposed to be off the table for discussion. Professor Kleinman sensibly noted that the form of the pledge was his biggest worry. It risked turning moral matter into a legal matter. Dean Harris seemed to agree, but immediately said that it <i>was</i>, after all, a legal matter; we couldn't escape that. Actually, I am not sure that followed. The rules about cheating are already in place; it seems to me that, unless existing rules about cheating are rescinded, the only new thing the mandatory pledge would add legally is a new rule that refusing to take the pledge would be unlawful. This point was muddy enough that I felt I should get absolute clarity. When Dean Harris said that students would be \"asked to\" sign the pledge or \"expected to\" sign the pledge, did he mean they would be required to sign the pledge? he answered in the affirmative.<br /><br />So the lack of discussion was not surprising; we had little in the way of an argument to think about before the meeting (though those of us who had been at the Town Meeting had a bit more, to the extent we could remember the arguments in the report without a text to refer to). I continue to be troubled by the whole proposal for theoretical, practical, and what I am going to call humane reasons.<br /><br />On the theory, I am with Morison, the historian of Harvard who described Harvard's aversion to pledge<span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">s: \"</span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">Our founders knew from their English experience that oaths are powerless to bind conscience. … Accordingly this academic vessel was provided with the barest possible code of statutes, and her master and crew, unhampered by oaths and religious tests, were left to exercise their best judgment, as God gave it to them.\" (</span></span><i style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit; line-height: 21px;\">History of Harvard College,</i><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;pp. 339-341.)&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span></span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">Interestingly, this is a disputed point. Not what the Founders may have thought, but whether they were right in thinking that oaths are powerless to bind conscience. To support the view that oaths are not powerless, a psychology professor cited a study concluding&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">that</span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;people who were asked whether they were going to vote and said yes were more likely to vote than people who were not asked. I am not a professional psychologist, but it seems a stretch to use that as an argument for </span></span><i style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 21px;\">forcing</i><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;people to take an oath. In any case, I find it repellent to turn this matter of academic integrity into an exercise in applied psychology. Perhaps we should just bring in folks from the advertising&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">industry</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">, who are so skilled at getting us to do things we might not otherwise do, to help us&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">brainwash</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;the student body. Surely, when we talk about academic integrity, we&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">should</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;honor the principle&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">that</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;each of us is in command of our free will. The really dishonorable thing would be to suggest that some random exogenous circumstance, the noise in the room or our failure to say our daily incantation, was a reason for our moral failure.</span></span></span></span><br /><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span></span></span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">As a practical matter, I still don't know what problem we are trying to solve or why this change should be expected to change it. I try always to remember that the first step in solving a problem is to&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">know</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;what problem you are solving. We got no data, except for a number or statements to the effect that the research shows that schools with honor codes have less cheating than those that don't. But we got nothing in the way of data about our own cheating, whether it is really on the rise, who does it,&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">whether</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">certain courses are problematic, etc. We got nothing about whether the Ad Board is a problem, either because it is making bad decisions, or taking too much time or money in making them, etc. At a minimum, we ought to have some criteria for success or failure before we change things, unless we don't care about success or failure.</span></span><br /><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">Which takes me to the humanity of it all. It is not so hard to apply rules about plagiarism and other forms of cheating unflinchingly, and to mete out formulaic penalties. The only time it gets tricky is if the judgments being made are considered educational, because then you have to look into the soul of the miscreants and make subjective judgments about what response will prove, later in their lives, to have been most constructive. That requires maturity, maturity which in my experience even new deans do not have until they had been around the block for a year or two.</span></span><br /><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">I have a lot of respect for students and how much smarter they are in many ways than the faculty are. I plan all my courses in collaboration with my undergraduate course assistants; they are much better than I am at anticipating how the incentives and rewards will work in the minds of students. But they are not mature enough to be making subjective, educational&nbsp;decisions about the souls of their classmates. The fact (<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/5/students-concerned-honor-code/\">if it is true</a>) that&nbsp;students want an honor board is about as relevant as was the fact that students wanted, twenty years ago, to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1996/3/8/housing-will-be-random-pwhen-first-year/\">pick which House they would live in</a>. It doesn't matter what a plebiscite would yield if it is an educationally inferior outcome.</span></span><br /><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">If, on the other hand, we are giving up on the educational role of the disciplinary process, and turning it into a simple matter of crime and punishment, then the honor board may make sense. But I should not be&nbsp;blogging about the honor board yet,&nbsp;since it was explicitly&nbsp;divided from the discussion of the honor&nbsp;code, but of&nbsp;course these are connected. We can't discuss either without discussing both and without saying more about why we are going to do what is proposed.</span></span><br /><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><i>[Corrected 2/9/14: \"honor court\" -&gt; \"honor code\" in penultimate sentence.]&nbsp;</i></span></span><br /><br />") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Why Are There So Many Course Lotteries?") (content ((type . "html")) "I signed a lot of study cards last week, not just because I am Director of Undergraduate Studies and have picked up a lot of advisees this term from faculty on leave, but because it seemed like every other student who came in had two or three study cards for me to sign. They listed various combinations of courses, and while a few students just didn't want to decide until the last possible moment, most of them were waiting for the results of course lotteries – the process by which limited enrollment courses are whittled down to size when too many students want to take them.<br /><br />Limited enrollment courses have been around forever. Seminars obviously have to be capped, because they wouldn't be seminars otherwise. I once decided to lift the cap on my freshman seminar from 12 to 15, because about 60 students wanted to get in. It was a big mistake. Talking in a group of 13 is different from talking in a group of 16.<br /><br />Courses with unusual equipment or classroom demands sometimes have to be capped. Again, film courses have long been capped, because cameras and whatnot are costly.<br /><br />As we move away from lecturing to flat-floor classroom teaching, the shortage of appropriate teaching spaces creates capacity problems. These are exaggerated, in the case of Computer Science, by huge enrollment swings in our direction. Our teaching facilities were not designed for the numbers of concentrators we have, and it is awfully costly to renovate space even if the space exists, which it doesn't. I know this is a problem in the lab sciences as well. It is a fair question whether the earnest efforts we have gone to in order to increase enrollments were matched by earnest planning about what would happen if we succeeded.<br /><br />In some fields, enrollment caps are a response to a shortage of TFs. CS has this problem for graduate courses (yes, some graduate coursed draw multiple dozens of students). Most undergraduate courses use many talented undergraduate course assistants, a resource which happily grows and shrinks in almost direct proportion to the enrollments in the courses. In humanistic fields that doesn't work, and even a small reduction in the number of PhD students makes the TF shortage even more acute.<br /><br />All that said, I can't ever remember a year when I had such a strong impression that lotteries are now accepted as a part of ordinary undergraduate life at Harvard. The difference is that a lot of the courses being lotteried are big courses, not small ones. They are General Education courses, not boutique courses on specialties that have suddenly become trendy.<br /><br />The <i><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/4/course-lotteries-frustration/\">Crimson</a></i>&nbsp;reports on this a bit today, listing some of the lotteried courses, and also noting, importantly, that not all \"lotteries\" are run the way the Numbers Game is run. What is politely termed a lottery is actually a second admissions process, as though, having gotten through the eye of the Admissions Committee's needle and made your way to Harvard, you should have to prove to a professor that you are worthy of enrolling in his or her Gen Ed course.<br /><br />This seems crazy, and wrong. We got rid of limited-enrollment concentrations some years ago, on the theory that anybody should be able to get an education in any concentration [major] at Harvard, if they were willing to work at it. And now we have filters on Gen Ed courses instead? This is what Harvard students should expect for their $60,000 per year? Sounds more like Berkeley.<br /><br />I wish I understood how this happened. In the old days, Bill Bossert used to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/9/25/if-you-miss-his-lecture-at/\">repeat his lectures </a>in&nbsp;Nat Sci 110, a classic Gen Ed course on computer science, because there was no lecture hall big enough to hold the whole class. That was extreme, but I wonder if there has not been an erosion of an old feeling that teaching was a mission, not just a job, and if a lot of students wanted to learn from you, it was an honor rather than a nuisance. One hears that some courses are limited just because … the professor doesn't like teaching big courses. That seems wrong.<br /><br />It seems to me a pretty simple expedient would solve most problems of over enrollment in large courses. Teach them at 9am! That would dis-enroll the gut-seekers and schedule-fitters, and would leave the professor with only the most committed students to teach. I really don't know why my colleagues don't try this -- in fact why not make it a rule? Any course lotteried one year has to be offered at 9am the following year. Bingo. Many fewer lotteries.<br /><br /><br />") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href . "http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/feeds/7043099604664202263/comments/default") (title .

The problem with this sort of thing is that there would be no end of apologies for what are recognized in retrospect as past institutional sins. I guess I should seek an apology from the University of Michigan Medical School because someone there, having given my mother the opportunity to be one of the few women in the class, told her that she couldn't be a neurologist and had to settle for being a psychiatrist.<br /><br />Seems to me Nohria might have done better to announce the changes he was making without trumpeting the apology so much. The changes are doubtless all to the good for today's students, both men and women -- why create the impression that you are doing them largely to make up for something your predecessors did wrong years ago? Anyway, if HBS starts paying reparations for its past mistreatment of women, I hope someone will let me know.

It's good old-fashioned investigative reporting, the kind a democracy needs to keep its politicians honest. It's slow, detailed, grinding work of a kind that it's hard to see being done by any form of journalism but newspapers.<br /><br />Helderman should get a Pulitzer for this series.<br /><br />Roz was class of 2001 at Harvard and was a <i>Crimson</i>&nbsp;editor. Among the beats on which she cut her teeth was … me. It was fun looking back at our early exchanges. The first story she did for which I was interviewed was on the potentially explosive subject of Harvard's compliance with Title IX in its athletic programs. She emailed me thirteen questions and wanted answers … that night. I did my best, from home and without a copy in hand of the self-study that precipitated the story. I dodged her last question, though: \"What is the history of women's sports at Harvard?\"<br /><br />The next story was about the role of Radcliffe.

In case you missed it, here is how it went, as I summarized the story in the <i><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harry-r-lewis/larry-summers-robert-rubi_b_419224.html\">Huffington Post</a></i>:</div><blockquote>In 1992, Andrei Shleifer, a Harvard professor and a close friend of Summers since Shleifer's college days at Harvard, became head of a Harvard project that directed U.S. government money for the development of the Russian economy. Tens of millions of dollars in noncompetitive U.S. contracts flowed to Harvard for Shleifer's Russian work, and his team directed the distribution of hundreds of millions more. Through the mid-1990s, complaints accumulated in Washington about self-dealing and improper investing by the Harvard team, and by mid-1997, the Harvard contracts had been canceled and the FBI had taken up the case. For two years it was before a federal grand jury.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>In September, 2000, the government sued Harvard, Shleifer, and others, claiming that Shleifer was lining his own pockets and those of his wife, hedge fund manager Nancy Zimmerman--formerly a vice president at Goldman Sachs under Rubin&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Soon after, when Summers became a candidate for the Harvard presidency, Shleifer lobbied hard for him in Cambridge. Rubin assured the Fellows that the abrasiveness Summers had exhibited at Treasury was a thing of the past. They named him president--in spite of what was already known about his enabling role in the malodorous Russian affair, and the implausibility of a personality metamorphosis.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Summers did not recuse himself from the lawsuit until more than three months after his selection as president, and even then used his influence to protect Shleifer. The Fellows--including Rubin, whom Summers added to the Corporation--fought the case for years, spending upwards of $10M on lawyers. But in 2005 a federal judge found Shleifer to have conspired to defraud the government and held Harvard liable as well. To settle the civil claims, Shleifer paid the government $2M and Harvard paid $26.5M; Zimmerman's company had already paid $1.5M. Shleifer denied all wrongdoing, and Harvard disclosed nothing about any response of its own--a departure from its handling of misconduct by faculty farther from the center of power.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Summers remained close to Shleifer, yet claimed in a February 2006 faculty meeting to know too little about the scandal to have formed an opinion about it. This prevarication brought a gasp from the assembled faculty and solidified faculty opposition to the Summers presidency.</blockquote>The definitive tick-tock on this unhappy mess is David McClintick's \"How Harvard Lost Russia,\" which appeared in <i><a href=\"http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/1020662/How-Harvard-lost-Russia.html?ArticleId=1020662&amp;p=1\">Institutional Investor</a>.</i>&nbsp;The narrative is full of minor characters, including one Leonard Blavatnik, also a Russian emigre with American citizenship. Here is what McClintick had to say about Blavatnik:<br /><br /><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\"><div class=\"layoutArea\"><div class=\"column\"><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">In 1994, Shleifer and Zimmerman, with the help and advice of Leonard Blavatnik, a New York-based Russian emigrant and a member of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Forbes </span>400, placed $200,000 in a Blavatnik vehicle called Renova-Invest, which invested in a group of Russian corporations that were being privatized under Shleifer's guidance. The companies included telephone operator Rostelecom; oil and natural-gas behemoth Gazprom; aluminum smelters in the cities of Irkutsk, Sayansk and Bratsk; Vladimir Tractor; and oil producer Chernogorneft. The U.S. government alleged in its complaint against Harvard, Shleifer and Hay that these companies benefited financially not only from Shleifer's advice on privatization but also from AID-funded assistance, including free legal services. When Blavatnik was merging several aluminum companies in which Shleifer and Zimmerman had invested, Hay and other AID-funded lawyers worked on the merger documents at no cost to Blavatnik or the companies. According to a U.S. statement of \"undisputed material facts\" submitted with the lawsuit, Hay was aware of some of the private investments of Shleifer and his wife, which were violations of the bars against private investment in Russia.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">…</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">In 1994, Shleifer and Zimmerman, with the help and advice of Leonard Blavatnik, a New York-based Russian emigrant and a member of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Forbes </span>400, placed $200,000 in a Blavatnik vehicle called Renova-Invest, which invested in a group of Russian corporations that were being privatized under Shleifer's guidance.

I did not think this story was likely to come around again, until I read a piece by Connie Bruck in the January 20 <i>New Yorker</i>&nbsp;called \"<a href=\"http://nyr.kr/19ZeiH0\">The Billionaire's Playlist</a>.\" The billionaire in question is Blavatnik, and the story is about his purchase of Warner Music, and how he got to be so rich (reportedly he is worth $18 billion). In addition to summarizing the same information I quote from McClintick above, Bruck adds some more color. Blavatnik played games with some paperwork -- changing an investment from Shleifer's name to Zimmerman's in an apparent attempt to avoid those pesky conflict of interest rules after the fact -- and then relied on Zimmerman when he needed to raise some big money:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">[Blavatnik] had turned his access to Americans into funding for his Russian ventures. In 1997 and 1998, Zimmerman's fund had made bridge loans that helped Blavatnik and his partners invest in Russian companies. According to Chernys's testimony, those loans amounted to at least forty-three million dollars.</blockquote>Bruck quotes \"an expression that is popular among Russian businessmen: 'Never ask about the first million.'\" She also quotes American entrepreneur Sam Zell about why it was so difficult to compete against Blavatnik in those days. \"Start with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and go from there.\"<br /><br />Blavatnik has recently become a major philanthropist. His $117 million dollar gift to Oxford University resulted in the naming of the School of Government after him. <a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/04/blavatnik_accelerator_donation/\">He gave Harvard</a>, from which he earned an MBA, $50 million to fund a life science entrepreneurship accelerator. He is part of the <a href=\"http://alumni.harvard.edu/events/your-harvard-london\">host committee</a> welcoming president Faust to London today.<br /><br />I suppose we could look at it this way: Blavatnik has used the wealth he began to accumulate with his sketchy business dealings with Shleifer to repay the $26.5 million fine Harvard paid, with $23.5 million in interest.<br /><br />It's a small world. Another Russian who plays a prominent role in Bruck's tale is Viktor Vekselberg, Blavatnik's business partner and the man whose foundation paid for casting a new set of Russian bells so the originals could be returned from Lowell House to their original home in the Danilov Monastery in Russia (a story told several years ago in the <i><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/04/27/090427fa_fact_batuman\">New Yorker</a>).</i><br /><br />It's more than a little discomfiting. But so is a great deal of fundraising; the tradition of people who have become wealthy in less than honorable ways elevating their reputation through their charitable donations has worked to the benefit of many a church, university, and city over the past couple of millennia. (There are plenty of Harvard case studies -- <a href=\"http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2013/11/they-arent-all-angels.html\">Buddy Fletcher</a>, for example. For that matter,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/09/gordon-mckay.html\">Gordon McKay</a>, the donor of my chair, was no angel.) I believe that universities are the kidneys of &nbsp;the nation -- they purify their tainted nutrients.<br /><br />As long as they don't get corrupted themselves, of course. As long as they don't give the tiller to people unfit to steer the ship. As long as they don't have to lie about their donors' character in exchange for the largesse -- and that is a tricky one, since attaching a donor's name to a school or a fund <i>is</i>&nbsp;a way of honoring them for who they are, not just for what they have given. As long as the money donated is merely malodorous, and not known to be the fruits of criminal activity.<br /><br />I hope the Blavanik money meets that low standard. Because students are watching, and they learn from everything we do. What is the lesson here? And because the world is watching, and as I <a href=\"http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2014/01/losing-trust-in-higher-education.html\">blogged</a> last week, it is already skeptical about our motives.<br /><br />And we should not forget that there is another way. Donors exist who are selfless and give not to enhance their social standing or to make up for past sins. Some people -- <a href=\"http://alumni.harvard.edu/stories/lebowitz\">Larry Lebowitz</a>, for example -- give in honor of others, and let their identity be known only in the hope that they will inspire others to do likewise. Their own names appear nowhere, and they are satisfied to have helped unknown beneficiaries in the distant future. I wish there were more of that humble spirit in this world, and more ways of showing our appreciation for it.<br /><br />(penultimate para revised 9:30am 1/20/14)<br /><br /></div></div></div>") (link ((rel .

The item was formally moved, so it could be voted at the next meeting.<br /><br />Several comments were offered to the effect that there would be something wrong with asking students to write the formulaic honor statement repeatedly. No decision has been taken as to how frequently the affirmation would have to be made, and that seems to me a problem with the legislation. As the <i><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/4/2/faculty-still-concerned-honor/\">Crimson</a></i>&nbsp;accurately quotes me as saying, there is a big difference between affirming one's commitment to academic integrity once at matriculation, or once a year, and reciting the commitment like a ritual prayer on each item of submitted academic work. (CS 20 students have to answer \"check in questions\" on the reading the night before every class. There are just three or four questions and they are multiple choice, click-click-click and you are done. Would they be expected to type out the honor pledge in addition?)<br /><br />I observed that it seemed to me unlikely that a defiant soul like Emerson would have ritually and uncomplainingly written out the honor pledge for four years. Wouldn't he and some of Harvard's other eminent nonconformists at some point have refused? What sanction would Harvard want to have visited on such young cranks, destined for greatness, for the perfectly logical sin of refusing to affirm their own honesty? I am trying to imagine Harvard's great logicians, Quine and Putnam and Sacks et al., explaining to their logic classes that yes, \"I am being honest\" is a self-refential, semantically challenged proposition, but it didn't matter, they had to keep saying something like that anyway, because the Faculty had voted to require it of them.<br /><br />Part of the rationale for the code is that we have a cheating problem, and schools with honor codes have less cheating. A literature review was offered in support of the latter thesis, but upon reading it, I am not convinced that it actually supports any such conclusion. (Alas, the literature review, like the draft honor code and implementing legislation, is confidential by the protocol of Faculty meetings, not to be shared with those who are not members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.)<br /><br />Even if it were true that reciting the pledge made people less likely to cheat, I wouldn't favor it. \"Why not, if it works?\" Because there are values more important than effectiveness. It might also work to lower the room temperature or to paint the walls pink, but academic integrity is not a matter of behavioral manipulation by tried and true methods of psychological trickery. If it were, we'd just hire an ad agency. And getting people to be honest at Harvard is not the objective anyway; we want to graduate honest people. When Harvard students become corporate executives or political leaders or professionals, there will be no one there to make them recite the pledge that reminded them to be honest while they were students. Integrity has to come from some deeper place in their beings.<br /><br />A requirement that students affirm the honor pledge, repeatedly, feels to me like an infringement of students' right to free speech, which includes not only the right to say what they wish but also not to say what they don't wish. &nbsp;Rather than training students to recite formulas, we should be educating them toward exactly the opposite frame of mind, to resist and challenge attempts to require them to say things.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I think the honor pledge is an attempt to find the solution to a problem under the lamppost that is easiest illuminated.<br /><br />Students cheat for a variety of reasons. But one important reason students cheat, especially in catastrophic cases like <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/\">Harvard's Gov 1310</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/3/13/dartmouth-drops-cheating-charges-pdartmouth-college/\">Dartmouth CS course</a> a few years ago, is that they feel they are being cheated. Students tend to work hard when they think the course is making an effort to teach well and to make fair demands on students; they cut corners when they think the demands on them are unfair, or they reason that lazy professors should expect little work in return. This is a version of Harvard sociologist Chris Winship's<a href=\"http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/cwinship/files/low_low.pdf\"> Low-Low Contract</a> between faculty and students: \"Faculty pretend to teach, students pretend to study, and as long as parents and others paying the bills are oblivious, everyone is happy.\" A major cheating scandal disrupts the oblivious compromise, but making students recite the honor pledge without changing faculty behavior isn't a solution to the real problem.<br /><br />Here is what I think is really going on, aside from those egregious examples of catastrophic failure. The Faculty, as a corporate body, honors students for basically only one thing: Grade Point Average. For honors a student requires a departmental recommendation in addition, especially for High and Highest Honors, but a large component of the basis for <i>those</i> recommendations is itself based on GPA. Of course, even to graduate without honors a student needs grades that are above a very low minimum. So grades are the coin of the realm, whether you are struggling to meet the minimum standard or vying to graduate <i>summa.</i><br /><br />We do nothing to control the currency. There has been no Faculty-wide discussion of grades in years. Instructors used to get information about overall grade distributions, but such information is no longer routinely distributed.<br /><br />The only person who ever asks about grades is <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/03/harvard-professor-raises-concerns-about-grade-inflation/McZHfRZ2RxpoP5Xvwged1N/story.html\">Professor Mansfield</a>, and he always couches his question as one about grade inflation, sometimes, in my <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2001/4/23/the-racial-theory-of-grade-inflation/\">opinion</a>, incorrectly.<br /><br />The result of the lack of effort at conversation, much less standardization, is that the grading practices of individual faculty members have drifted apart. The only people who realize that this is happening seem to be the students who go from one course to another and are surprised, at the end of the term, to discover that quite different standards have been applied. Sometimes students make life-altering decisions as a result of their very limited view of Harvard grading practices. Economics Professor Claudia Goldin recently discovered quite <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/catherine-rampell-women-should-embrace-the-bs-in-college-to-make-more-later/2014/03/10/1e15113a-a871-11e3-8d62-419db477a0e6_story.html\">stunning differences</a> between the way men and women respond to getting B's in introductory economics. If Econ gives a B for the level of work for which English or Computer Science gives an A–, the variability is important, regardless of the compression. (I have no idea whether that might be true, but we did decide a year ago to offer a SAT-UNSAT track through our introductory course.)<br /><br />I have thought about things that my own Computer Science colleagues might do without a College-wide reform movement. We could certainly talk to each other about our grading practices, and we have started to do that. A more radical step would be to stop basing our honors recommendations so much on GPA. We might, for example, collectively examine and discuss students' programs, and reward, quite subjectively, the programs that are ambitious and daring as well as meeting some more relaxed standard of achievement. This would have various problems -- there could be inconsistencies and biases, and students would still have to meet certain College-wide grading standards to actually receive honors, whatever the local faculty group might recommend. It might be unworkable and it might be unfair, but the alternative is not without its own problems. Carrying out GPA calculations to five decimal places to check against a numerical threshold, when the input data are so noisy, uncalibrated, and unreliable, ought to offend the sensibilities of any proper scholar.<br /><br />Students, to the extent they understand that they are playing a game (one course from each of 8 Gen Ed areas, so many for the concentration, grading standards all over the place, and your goal is to exceed GPA x in the concentration and GPA y overall, while relying on assumptions and gossip about the grading practices in individual courses), are likely to cut corners when they decide the rules of the game are meaningless and the objective is arbitrary but valuable. One way of cutting corners is to take the easiest courses. Another is to take the courses you already know the best, and from which you will therefore learn the least, because the only metric for which Harvard will reward you is the grade you receive. And another is to skim the edge of honest behavior and hope you won't get caught, especially in a course where the professor doesn't seem to care much about what students are doing.<br /><br />I wish we could go after the real problem rather than the symptoms. I don't look kindly on cheating and I wish there were less of it (though I don't really have the sense that there is a lot of it in my courses). But to say that we need to respond with an honor code to our cheating problem, rather than taking up some of the larger educational issues that lie behind it, is a mistake.

That victory came Friday night, as the women's team was beating Yale at Harvard at the same time as the men's team was clinching the Ivy championship in New Haven.<br /><br />Coach Delaney-Smith is a complete anomaly in today's collegiate sports world. She has coached at Harvard for 32 seasons, and never coached at any other college. Harvard hired her from a local high school, where she had picked up basketball coaching as an add-on to what started out as a job coaching the swim team. She hadn't even played the five-on-five game herself. When she came to Harvard she stepped into the shoes of no giant, inherited no grand recruiting tradition. She achieved her successes by hard work, study, and personal magnetism.<br /><br />Coach Delaney-Smith must have had a million opportunities to jump to other schools. Her teams have won 11 Ivy championships. One of the most exciting moments of my years as dean came in 1998, when she took one of those championship teams to the NCAA tournament and, seeded 16 in their bracket, knocked off #1 Stanford. Only time it's ever happened in either the men's or women's game.<br /><br />What makes the Globe profile so good is that it emphasizes Delaney-Smith's relation to her players, and how those relations persist. I've heard it from her alums, and she describes it exactly the same way they do.<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">“I love Ivy League titles,” she said. “I love the banners in my gym, and I’m very proud of them. But more important than that for me is my athletes, my alumni, their experience. I’m really in it for my student-athletes, not for my records. I want them to grow, I want them to be rewarded.</span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">“I love when my alumni come back and talk about and share their experiences with each other and with me about how important being part of the Harvard basketball program was to them and their lives.”</span></blockquote>Yup. That is the person I know. I wish we saw that spirit in the faculty more often than I do. I've always found it telling that the advertisements for coaches' jobs at Harvard talks about those values, of the importance of mentoring and developing the character of students during their formative years. I've been on search committees for coaches, and there is as much talk about character as there is about Xs and Os.<br /><br />No ad I've seen for a faculty position mentions the developmental role of the professor. No faculty hiring committee would discuss such things, at least not for long. Nor does the incentive and reward system for faculty take much account of whether a professor has such relationships with students.

It always just seemed to me common courtesy, whatever the policy, and I am glad that what should all along have been good manners will likely become an official rule.<br />     </div></div></div>") (link ((rel .

"The student government at Harvard, known as the Undergraduate Council, has long been a weak organization. Seats go <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/18/uc-special-election-housing/\">uncontested</a>, and the last presidential election was won by a guy who pretty much made a <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/11/22/clark-mayopoulos-win-resign/\">joke</a> out of his campaign.<br /><br />Part of the reason is structural. Harvard has a strong collegiate staff, so some services that student governments provide at other universities are centrally provided here. That has always helped explain why the student government here gets less funding than it does elsewhere. I think part of the problem is also the general problem of diversity. Harvard students are interested in so many different things that it's hard to find a majority opinion on anything that matters. The endless controversies over the choice of bands for Springfest seem to me almost inevitable; there simply is no majority opinion on musical tastes.<br /><br />The UC is funded by a $75 term bill fee that is itemized so students can opt out of it. The opting-out requires the effort of sending a letter to the term bill office--not a major burden by any means, but enough of an annoyance that most students who are indifferent or hostile to the UC don't bother to hold back their financial support. (I think. There used to be very high compliance, don't truly know about now.)<br /><br />Over the past month there has been a somewhat puzzling series of Crimson stories about the UC's desire to get $250,000 more per year to expand its activities. The <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/20/pfister-supports-increased-funding/\">Dean</a> of the College and the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/20/uc-faust-additional-funding/\">President</a> have said sympathetic things but have observed that they are dealing with budget problems of their own. I paid little attention to this until I suddenly realized that I had been there, fifteen years ago, when the UC wanted to raise the fee from $20. I eventually decided that should happen, and I wrote an <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/11/29/raise-the-council-fee-pshould-the/\">op-ed for the Crimson</a> explaining my view. I think it went to $35 shortly thereafter, so the fee has already more than doubled since then.<br /><br />My general view has always been that extracurricular activities should be supported, at least the ones that students learn something from or that keep them healthy. (I have always been less sympathetic to the identity-politics groups.) Aside from whatever practical lessons such group activities teach about cooperation and leadership, and what intellectual or career-oriented skills they may foster, they on average tend to reduce drinking. Oh, I know all about the rugby team and the initiation rituals, but in general, I am persuaded that students who are busy doing something are less likely to spend their evenings wasted than students who have nothing to do but pass their courses.<br /><br />(And drinking is a problem; the freshman formal was shut down early a few weeks ago, and the Crimson has a long <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/20/drinking-games-party-smart/\">piece</a> about Harvard's bingeing culture.)<br /><br />Add to that, the fact that Harvard has apparently reduced its support of club sports to save money, so the UC has a reasonable argument that it needs to take up the slack. I'm not sure I like the vector there: to save money, one department reduces its services to students, so students ask for money to replace those services, except the student body itself controls how that money is allocated. The pirouette may leave students paying the same amount of money and the university losing control over its allocation, while proudly announcing that it has reduced its budget gap.<br /><br />But here is the part of the story that I don't get. \"Mayopoulos and Goffard, who hosted a rally in the Yard before their meeting with Faust, said that they discussed the additional funding’s importance with the president and how it might be acquired, either through a term bill increase or directly from the University.\" So they hold a rally, and then ask the president for a quarter of a million dollars. She says \"no\" to direct funding, and quite rightly directs them to Dean Pfister to talk about the term bill mechanism. But the UC doesn't stop here. \"Mayopoulos said that that Harvard 'should bear a significant amount of the cost of extracurriculars' on campus. 'If an increase in the term bill is necessary, this increase will be matched by the University so that students are not alone in this,' &nbsp;he said.\"<br /><br />Probably this is just the kind of low-grade populism for which the UC has always won scorn, and I should leave it alone. Still, it's embarrassing for the future leaders of the free world, and I worry that it's part of the infantilization process I have been observing for some time. It's one thing to ask for the student government to ask permission to raise the term bill fee. Every time such a request is granted, there is the potential for an instant plebiscite. If students don't want to turn over their money to the UC, they can opt out. Just as in any representative democracy, the expectation of the electorate for prudent spending of resources raised through taxation provides a counterweight to the ambitions of the political class to expand the central budget. It's a healthy tradeoff. It's so much easier, and less realistic, for the UC just to ask the university to turn over the money and trust them, rather than for the UC to ask the entire student body to trust them, one term bill payer at a time.<br /><br />Acting like a teenager asking for an allowance is so different from asking for authority to raise a voluntary tax on your constituents. Holding a rally over this, when there are real problems in the university and in the world worth rallying over, is childish.

She reminds me that my own <a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/09/reinventing-the-classroom\">decision</a> to start teaching a flipped-classroom course, rather than trying to go the MOOC route, was in part a reaction to my fear of MOOCification, and was driven by the rewards I get from hearing chatter in the classroom, from bantering with students, from seeing light bulbs lighting up over their heads. \"[W]e need a college-wide discussion,\" Professor Lewis goes on to say, \"of how to maintain our pedagogical values in the brave new world of online education.\" Amen.")

But Harvard, mistakenly, continued report its value as income on employees' W-2s. Unfortunate, and costly to employees, because they had to pay taxes on what should have been nontaxable benefits.

Dean Jay Harris presented it, and Melissa Franklin, Arthur Kleinman, and I commented briefly. <a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/02/harvard-college-honor-code\">Harvard Magazine</a> has a fuller account than the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/5/faculty-voice-few-opinions/#\">Crimson</a>. Professor Franklin asked the obvious question, given all the talk about this honor code being a way to bring students into partnership with the faculty rather than having the faculty act as their superiors. Why not expect the faculty to sign the honor code too?<br /><br />But the discussion was thin because the materials to discuss were thin. The honor board was off the table for now. Even the report laying out the case for an honor code was off the table. A draft had been available last year via authenticated login, but was never made public. As I recall it was discussed at one poorly attended \"town meeting,\"not even a regular faculty meeting. I am not even sure it was generally available to students, whose support for an honor code was cited in the faculty meeting. I conclude I was, for some reason, not supposed to refresh my memory about what it said. (I found it eventually on the web site of the Secretary of the Faculty; the draft report is dated March 26, 2013, but it's confidential. <a href=\"http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1238498.files//Honor%20Code%20Progress%20Statement%204.9.13.pdf\">Here it is</a>, for those authorized to see it.)<br /><br />Even what is likely to be the most sensitive question, whether students will be required to write out the mandated pledge on every piece of academic work they submit, was supposed to be off the table for discussion. Professor Kleinman sensibly noted that the form of the pledge was his biggest worry. It risked turning moral matter into a legal matter. Dean Harris seemed to agree, but immediately said that it <i>was</i>, after all, a legal matter; we couldn't escape that. Actually, I am not sure that followed. The rules about cheating are already in place; it seems to me that, unless existing rules about cheating are rescinded, the only new thing the mandatory pledge would add legally is a new rule that refusing to take the pledge would be unlawful. This point was muddy enough that I felt I should get absolute clarity. When Dean Harris said that students would be \"asked to\" sign the pledge or \"expected to\" sign the pledge, did he mean they would be required to sign the pledge? he answered in the affirmative.<br /><br />So the lack of discussion was not surprising; we had little in the way of an argument to think about before the meeting (though those of us who had been at the Town Meeting had a bit more, to the extent we could remember the arguments in the report without a text to refer to). I continue to be troubled by the whole proposal for theoretical, practical, and what I am going to call humane reasons.<br /><br />On the theory, I am with Morison, the historian of Harvard who described Harvard's aversion to pledge<span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">s: \"</span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">Our founders knew from their English experience that oaths are powerless to bind conscience. … Accordingly this academic vessel was provided with the barest possible code of statutes, and her master and crew, unhampered by oaths and religious tests, were left to exercise their best judgment, as God gave it to them.\" (</span></span><i style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit; line-height: 21px;\">History of Harvard College,</i><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;pp. 339-341.)&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span></span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">Interestingly, this is a disputed point. Not what the Founders may have thought, but whether they were right in thinking that oaths are powerless to bind conscience. To support the view that oaths are not powerless, a psychology professor cited a study concluding&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">that</span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;people who were asked whether they were going to vote and said yes were more likely to vote than people who were not asked. I am not a professional psychologist, but it seems a stretch to use that as an argument for </span></span><i style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 21px;\">forcing</i><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;people to take an oath. In any case, I find it repellent to turn this matter of academic integrity into an exercise in applied psychology. Perhaps we should just bring in folks from the advertising&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">industry</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">, who are so skilled at getting us to do things we might not otherwise do, to help us&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">brainwash</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;the student body.

"text")) "The honor code discussion continues") (content ((type . "html")) "The Honor code was discussed at the FAS faculty meeting yesterday. Dean Jay Harris presented it, and Melissa Franklin, Arthur Kleinman, and I commented briefly. <a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/02/harvard-college-honor-code\">Harvard Magazine</a> has a fuller account than the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/5/faculty-voice-few-opinions/#\">Crimson</a>. Professor Franklin asked the obvious question, given all the talk about this honor code being a way to bring students into partnership with the faculty rather than having the faculty act as their superiors. Why not expect the faculty to sign the honor code too?<br /><br />But the discussion was thin because the materials to discuss were thin. The honor board was off the table for now. Even the report laying out the case for an honor code was off the table. A draft had been available last year via authenticated login, but was never made public. As I recall it was discussed at one poorly attended \"town meeting,\"not even a regular faculty meeting. I am not even sure it was generally available to students, whose support for an honor code was cited in the faculty meeting. I conclude I was, for some reason, not supposed to refresh my memory about what it said. (I found it eventually on the web site of the Secretary of the Faculty; the draft report is dated March 26, 2013, but it's confidential. <a href=\"http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1238498.files//Honor%20Code%20Progress%20Statement%204.9.13.pdf\">Here it is</a>, for those authorized to see it.)<br /><br />Even what is likely to be the most sensitive question, whether students will be required to write out the mandated pledge on every piece of academic work they submit, was supposed to be off the table for discussion. Professor Kleinman sensibly noted that the form of the pledge was his biggest worry. It risked turning moral matter into a legal matter. Dean Harris seemed to agree, but immediately said that it <i>was</i>, after all, a legal matter; we couldn't escape that. Actually, I am not sure that followed. The rules about cheating are already in place; it seems to me that, unless existing rules about cheating are rescinded, the only new thing the mandatory pledge would add legally is a new rule that refusing to take the pledge would be unlawful. This point was muddy enough that I felt I should get absolute clarity. When Dean Harris said that students would be \"asked to\" sign the pledge or \"expected to\" sign the pledge, did he mean they would be required to sign the pledge? he answered in the affirmative.<br /><br />So the lack of discussion was not surprising; we had little in the way of an argument to think about before the meeting (though those of us who had been at the Town Meeting had a bit more, to the extent we could remember the arguments in the report without a text to refer to). I continue to be troubled by the whole proposal for theoretical, practical, and what I am going to call humane reasons.<br /><br />On the theory, I am with Morison, the historian of Harvard who described Harvard's aversion to pledge<span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">s: \"</span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">Our founders knew from their English experience that oaths are powerless to bind conscience. … Accordingly this academic vessel was provided with the barest possible code of statutes, and her master and crew, unhampered by oaths and religious tests, were left to exercise their best judgment, as God gave it to them.\" (</span></span><i style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit; line-height: 21px;\">History of Harvard College,</i><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;pp. 339-341.)&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\"><br /></span></span></span><span style=\"background-color: #fff9ee;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">Interestingly, this is a disputed point. Not what the Founders may have thought, but whether they were right in thinking that oaths are powerless to bind conscience. To support the view that oaths are not powerless, a psychology professor cited a study concluding&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">that</span></span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px;\">&nbsp;people who were asked whether they were going to vote and said yes were more likely to vote than people who were not asked.

The difference is that a lot of the courses being lotteried are big courses, not small ones. They are General Education courses, not boutique courses on specialties that have suddenly become trendy.<br /><br />The <i><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/4/course-lotteries-frustration/\">Crimson</a></i>&nbsp;reports on this a bit today, listing some of the lotteried courses, and also noting, importantly, that not all \"lotteries\" are run the way the Numbers Game is run. What is politely termed a lottery is actually a second admissions process, as though, having gotten through the eye of the Admissions Committee's needle and made your way to Harvard, you should have to prove to a professor that you are worthy of enrolling in his or her Gen Ed course.<br /><br />This seems crazy, and wrong. We got rid of limited-enrollment concentrations some years ago, on the theory that anybody should be able to get an education in any concentration [major] at Harvard, if they were willing to work at it. And now we have filters on Gen Ed courses instead? This is what Harvard students should expect for their $60,000 per year? Sounds more like Berkeley.<br /><br />I wish I understood how this happened. In the old days, Bill Bossert used to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/9/25/if-you-miss-his-lecture-at/\">repeat his lectures </a>in&nbsp;Nat Sci 110, a classic Gen Ed course on computer science, because there was no lecture hall big enough to hold the whole class. That was extreme, but I wonder if there has not been an erosion of an old feeling that teaching was a mission, not just a job, and if a lot of students wanted to learn from you, it was an honor rather than a nuisance. One hears that some courses are limited just because … the professor doesn't like teaching big courses. That seems wrong.<br /><br />It seems to me a pretty simple expedient would solve most problems of over enrollment in large courses. Teach them at 9am! That would dis-enroll the gut-seekers and schedule-fitters, and would leave the professor with only the most committed students to teach. I really don't know why my colleagues don't try this -- in fact why not make it a rule? Any course lotteried one year has to be offered at 9am the following year. Bingo. Many fewer lotteries.<br /><br /><br />" "http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/feeds/7043099604664202263/comments/default" (21233 21105) old 22 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3116442395849122822.post-7043099604664202263") (published nil "2014-02-04T12:49:00.004-08:00") (updated nil "2014-02-04T12:49:53.234-08:00") (title ((type .

They are General Education courses, not boutique courses on specialties that have suddenly become trendy.<br /><br />The <i><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/4/course-lotteries-frustration/\">Crimson</a></i>&nbsp;reports on this a bit today, listing some of the lotteried courses, and also noting, importantly, that not all \"lotteries\" are run the way the Numbers Game is run. What is politely termed a lottery is actually a second admissions process, as though, having gotten through the eye of the Admissions Committee's needle and made your way to Harvard, you should have to prove to a professor that you are worthy of enrolling in his or her Gen Ed course.<br /><br />This seems crazy, and wrong. We got rid of limited-enrollment concentrations some years ago, on the theory that anybody should be able to get an education in any concentration [major] at Harvard, if they were willing to work at it. And now we have filters on Gen Ed courses instead? This is what Harvard students should expect for their $60,000 per year? Sounds more like Berkeley.<br /><br />I wish I understood how this happened. In the old days, Bill Bossert used to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/9/25/if-you-miss-his-lecture-at/\">repeat his lectures </a>in&nbsp;Nat Sci 110, a classic Gen Ed course on computer science, because there was no lecture hall big enough to hold the whole class. That was extreme, but I wonder if there has not been an erosion of an old feeling that teaching was a mission, not just a job, and if a lot of students wanted to learn from you, it was an honor rather than a nuisance. One hears that some courses are limited just because … the professor doesn't like teaching big courses. That seems wrong.<br /><br />It seems to me a pretty simple expedient would solve most problems of over enrollment in large courses. Teach them at 9am! That would dis-enroll the gut-seekers and schedule-fitters, and would leave the professor with only the most committed students to teach. I really don't know why my colleagues don't try this -- in fact why not make it a rule? Any course lotteried one year has to be offered at 9am the following year. Bingo. Many fewer lotteries.<br /><br /><br />") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href . "http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/feeds/7043099604664202263/comments/default") (title .
