"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm only about halfway through <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=UcIkAwAAQBAJ\">Flash Boys</a> but have already come across a couple of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/451329576040275968\">striking</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/452821826452733952\">examples</a> of what might charitably be called <i>superfluous financial intermediation</i>. <br /><br />This is the practice of inserting oneself between a buyer and a seller of an asset, when both parties have <i>already communicated</i> to the market a willingness to trade at a mutually acceptable price. If the intermediary were simply absent from the marketplace, a trade would occur between the parties virtually instantaneously at a single price that is acceptable to both. Instead, both parties trade against the intermediary, at different prices. The intermediary captures the spread at the expense of the parties who wish to transact, adds nothing to liquidity in the market for the asset, and doubles the notional volume of trade.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/451329576040275968\">first example</a> may be summarized as follows. A hundred thousand shares in a company have been offered for sale at a specified price across multiple exchanges. A single buyer wishes to purchase the whole lot and is willing to pay the asked price. He places a single buy order to this effect. The order first reaches BATS, where it is partially filled for ten thousand shares; it is then routed to the other exchanges for completion. An intermediary, having seen the original buy order on arrival at BATS, places orders to buy the remaining ninety thousand shares on the other exchanges. This latter order travels faster and trades first, so the original buyer receives only partial fulfillment. The intermediary immediately posts offers to sell ninety thousand shares at a slightly higher price, which the original buyer is likely to accept. All this in a matter of milliseconds.<br /><br />The intermediary here is serving no useful economic function. Volume is significantly higher than it otherwise would have been, but there has been no increase in market liquidity. Had there been no intermediary present, the buyer and sellers would have transacted without any discernible delay, at a price that would have been better for the buyer and no worse for the sellers. Furthermore, an order is allowed to trade ahead of one that made its first contact with the market at an earlier point in time.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/452821826452733952\">second example</a>&nbsp;involves interactions between a dark pool and the public markets. Suppose that the highest bid price for a stock in the public exchanges is $100.00, and the lowest ask is $100.10. An individual submits a bid for a thousand shares at $100.05 to a dark pool, where it remains invisible and awaits a matching order. Shortly thereafter, a sell order for a thousand shares at $100.01 is placed at a public exchange. These orders are compatible and should trade against each other at a single price. Instead, both trade against an intermediary, which buys at the lower price, sells at the higher price, and captures the spread.<br /><br />As in the first example, the intermediary is not providing any benefit to either transacting party, and is not adding liquidity to the market for the asset. Volume is doubled but no economic purpose is served. Transactions that were about to occur anyway are preempted by a fraction of a second, and a net transfer of resources from investors to intermediaries is the only lasting consequence.<br /><br />Michael Lewis has focused on practices such as these because their social wastefulness and fundamental unfairness is so transparent. But it's important to recognize that most of the strategies implemented by high frequency trading firms may not be quite so easy to classify or condemn. For instance, how is one to evaluate trading based on short term price forecasts based on genuinely public information? I have tried to argue in earlier posts that the proliferation of such <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/blame-instructions-not-machines.html\">information extracting strategies</a> can give rise to greater price volatility. Furthermore, an <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/12/risk-and-reward-in-high-frequency.html\">arms race</a> among intermediaries willing to sink significant resources into securing the slightest of speed advantages must ultimately be paid for by investors. This is an immediate consequence of what I like to call <a href=\"http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/WSJ_2-07.pdf\">Bogle's Law</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It is the iron law of the markets, the undefiable rules of arithmetic: Gross return in the market, less the costs of financial intermediation, equals the net return actually delivered to market participants.</blockquote>I hope that the minor&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/452416112831918080\">factual</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/452419445730725888\">errors</a>&nbsp;in Flash Boys won't detract from the book's main message, or derail the important and overdue debate that it has predictably stirred. By focusing on the most egregious practices Lewis has already picked the low-hanging fruit. What remains to be figured out is how typical such practices really are. Taking full account of the range of strategies used by high frequency traders, to what extent are our asset markets characterized by superfluous financial intermediation?</div>") (link ((rel .

Allowing individuals to hold accounts at the Fed would result in a payments system that is insulated from banking crises. It would make deposit insurance completely unnecessary, thus removing a key subsidy that makes debt financing of asset positions so appealing to banks. There would be no need to impose <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=VajJ26Tx344C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=admati+hellwig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DO2MUp8K5sqwBLzhgJgB&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22higher%20capital%20requirements%22&amp;f=false\">higher capital requirements</a>, since a fragile capital structure would result in a deposit drain. And there would be no need to require banks to offer <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z4-gTS6F17IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lawrence+kotlikoff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=juyMUpD1DYmzsASznYGQDA&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cash%20mutual%20funds%22&amp;f=false\">cash mutual funds</a>, since the accounts at the Fed would serve precisely this purpose.<br /><br />But the greatest benefit of such a policy would lie elsewhere, in providing the Fed with a vastly superior monetary transmission mechanism. In a brief&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2013/07/02/implementing-the-helicopter-drop/#comment-177571\">comment</a>&nbsp;on Macroeconomic Resilience a few months ago, I proposed that an account be created at the Fed for every individual with a social security number, including minors. Any profits accruing to the Fed as a result of its open market operations could then be used to credit these accounts instead of being transferred to the Treasury. But these credits should not be immediately available for withdrawal: they should be released in increments if and when monetary easing is called for.<br /><br />The main advantage of such an approach is that it directly eases <i>debtor</i> balance sheets when a recession hits. It can provide a buffer to those facing financial distress, allowing payments to be made on mortgages or auto loans in the face of an unexpected loss of income. And as children transition into adulthood, they will find themselves with accumulated deposits that could be used to finance educational expenditures or a down payment on a home.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">In contrast, monetary policy as currently practiced targets <i>creditor</i> balance sheets. Asset prices rise as interest rates are driven down. The goal is to stimulate expenditure by lowering borrowing costs, but by definition this requires individuals to take on more debt. In an over-leveraged economy struggling through a balance sheet recession, such policies can only provide temporary relief.&nbsp;</div><br />No matter how monetary policy is implemented, it has distributional effects. As a result, the impact on real&nbsp;income growth of a given nominal target is sensitive to the monetary transmission mechanism in place. One of the things I find most puzzling and frustrating about current debates concerning monetary policy is the focus on targets rather than mechanisms. To my mind, the choice of target---whether the inflation rate or nominal income growth or something entirely different---is of secondary importance compared to the mechanism used to attain it.<br /><br />Rogoff was followed at the podium by Larry Summers, who voiced fears that we face a long period of <a href=\"http://equitablegrowth.org/2013/11/16/759/this-mornings-must-watch-larry-summers-on-the-danger-of-a-japan-like-generation-of-secular-stagnation-here-in-the-north-atlantic\">secular stagnation</a>. Paul Krugman has <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/secular-stagnation-coalmines-bubbles-and-larry-summers/?_r=0\">endorsed</a> this view. I think that this fate can be avoided, but not by fiddling with inflation or nominal growth targets. The Fed is currently hobbled not by the choice of an inappropriate goal, but by the limited menu of transmission mechanisms at its disposal. If all you can do in the face of excessive indebtedness is to encourage more borrowing, swapping one target for another is not going to solve the problem. Thinking more imaginatively about mechanisms is absolutely essential, otherwise we may well be facing a lost decade of our own. </div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type .

"text")) "The Romney Whale") (content ((type . "html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">In my last <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2013/09/information-beliefs-and-trading.html\">post</a> I referenced a paper with David Rothschild that we <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2322420\">posted</a> earlier this month. The main goal of that work was to try to examine the manner in which new information is transmitted to asset prices, and to distinguish empirically between two <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210\">influential</a> <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">theories</a> of trading. To accomplish this we examined in close detail every transaction on Intrade over the two week period immediately preceding the 2012 presidential election. We looked at about 84,000 transactions involving 3.5 million contracts and over 3,200 unique accounts, and in the process of doing so quickly realized that a single trader was responsible for about a third of all bets on Romney to win, and had wagered and lost close to 4 million dollars in just this one fortnight. &nbsp; <br /><br />While this discovery was (and remains) incidental to the main message of the paper, it has attracted a great deal of media attention over the past couple of days. (About a dozen articles are linked <a href=\"http://www.barnard.edu/news/research-prof-rajiv-sethi-examines-betting-during-2012-presidential-election\">here</a>, and there have been a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101062237\">couple</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/09/25/romney-backer-lost-4-million-plus-on-intrade-in-possible-manipulation-attempt-researchers/\">more</a>&nbsp;published since.) Most of these reports state the basic facts and make some conjectures about motivation. The purpose of this post is to describe and interpret what we found in a bit more detail. Much of what is said here can also be found in Section 5 of the paper.<br /><br />To begin with, the discovery of a large trader with significant exposure to a Romney loss was not a surprise. There was discussion of a possible \"Romney Whale\" in the Intrade chat rooms and elsewhere leading up to the election, as well as open recognition of the possibility of arbitrage with Betfair. On the afternoon of election day I noticed that the order book for Romney contracts was unusually asymmetric, with the number of bids far exceeding the number of offers, and posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">this</a>:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oNfraAyAJLw/UkO-dgxs6XI/AAAAAAAAB-k/Vw7HqCZ7Qns/s1600/tweet.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oNfraAyAJLw/UkO-dgxs6XI/AAAAAAAAB-k/Vw7HqCZ7Qns/s400/tweet.png\" width=\"290\" /></a></div><br />This was circulated quite widely thanks to the following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinwolfers/status/265923012610650112\">response</a>:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b-fgXd0LxSg/UkO-j_c7MCI/AAAAAAAAB-w/zWh2YIjR47c/s1600/wolferstweet.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b-fgXd0LxSg/UkO-j_c7MCI/AAAAAAAAB-w/zWh2YIjR47c/s400/wolferstweet.png\" width=\"288\" /></a></div><br />In a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">post</a>&nbsp;on the following day I explained why I thought that is was an attempt at manipulation:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Could this not have been just a big bet, placed by someone optimistic about Romney's chances? I don't think so, for two reasons. First, if one wanted to bet on Romney rather than Obama, much better odds were available elsewhere, for instance on Betfair. More importantly, one would not want to leave such large orders standing at a time when new information was emerging rapidly; the risk of having the orders met by someone with superior information would be too great. Yet these orders stood for hours, and effectively placed a floor on the Romney price and a ceiling on the price for Obama.</blockquote>Ron Bernstein at Intrade has <a href=\"https://www.intrade.com/v4/home/\">explained</a>&nbsp;why the disparity with Betfair is not surprising given the severe constraints faced by US residents in opening and operating accounts at the latter exchange, and the differential fee structure. Nevertheless, I still find the second explanation compelling.<br /><br />The strategic manner in which these orders were placed, with large bids at steadily declining intervals, suggested to me that this was an experienced trader making efficient use of the available funds to order to have the maximum price impact. The orders lower down on the bid side of the book served as deterrents, revealing to counterparties that a sale at the best bid would not result in a price collapse. This is why I described the trader as sophisticated in my conversations with reporters at the <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/23/one-big-trader-lost-millions-betting-on-romney-study-finds/\">WSJ</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/study-bettor-lost-4m-on-mitt-romney-97269.html?hp=r6\">Politico</a>. &nbsp;Characterizing his behavior as <a href=\"http://gawker.com/which-stupid-millionaire-lost-a-fortune-betting-on-mitt-1377376456\">stupid</a> presumes that this was a series of bets made with in the conviction that Romney would prevail, which I doubt.<br /><br />But if this was an attempt to manipulate prices, what was it's purpose? We consider a couple of different possibilities in the paper. The one that has been most widely reported is that it was at attempt to boost campaign contributions, morale, and turnout. But there's another very different possibility that's worth considering.<br /><br />On the afternoon of the 2004 presidential election exit polls were leaked that suggested a surprise victory by John Kerry, and the result was a sharp rise in the price of his Tradesports contract. (Tradesports was a precursor to Intrade.) This was sustained for several hours until election returns began to come in that were not consistent with the reported polls. In an interesting <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25098859\">study</a> published in 2007, Snowberg, Wolfers and Zitzewitz used this event to examine the effects on the S&amp;P futures market of beliefs about the electoral outcome. They found that perceptions of a Kerry victory resulted in a decline in the price of the index, an effect they interpreted as causal. The following chart from their paper makes the point quite vividly:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uoxC2qn1QLI/UkPIwiHmUdI/AAAAAAAAB_A/hIX9x8UkyKQ/s1600/Snowberg.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uoxC2qn1QLI/UkPIwiHmUdI/AAAAAAAAB_A/hIX9x8UkyKQ/s400/Snowberg.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Motivated in part by this finding, we wondered whether the manipulation of beliefs about the electoral outcome could have been motivated by financial gain. If Intrade could be used to manipulate beliefs in a manner that affected the value a stock price index, or specific securities such as health or oil and gas stocks, then a four million dollar loss could be easily compensated by a much larger gain elsewhere. Could this have provided motivation for the behavior of our large trader?<br /><br />We decided that this was extremely unlikely, for two reasons. First, the 2004 analysis showed only that changes in beliefs affected the index, not that the Intrade price caused the change in beliefs. In fact, it was the leaked exit polls that affected both the Intrade price and the S&amp;P 500 futures market. This does not mean that a change in the Intrade price, absent confirming evidence from elsewhere, could not have a causal impact on other asset prices. It's possible that it could, but not plausible in our estimation.<br /><br />Furthermore, the partisan effects identified by Snowberg et al. were completely absent in 2012. In fact, if anything, the effects were reversed. S&amp;P 500 futures reacted <i>negatively</i> to an increase in perceptions of a Romney victory during the first debate, and <i>positively</i> to the announcement of the result on election day. One possible reason is that monetary policy was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/business/debating-the-elections-cause-and-effect-on-wall-street.html\">expected</a> to be tighter under a Romney administration. Here is the chart for the first debate:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kDxuekHj2n8/UkPM4ac_i2I/AAAAAAAAB_U/2arUA32lrl8/s1600/FirstDebate_5PM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"245\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kDxuekHj2n8/UkPM4ac_i2I/AAAAAAAAB_U/2arUA32lrl8/s400/FirstDebate_5PM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />The index falls as Romney's prospects appear to be rising, but the effect is clearly minor. The main point is that any attempt to use 2004 correlations to influence the S&amp;P via changes in Intrade prices, even if they were successful in altering beliefs about the election, would have been futile or counterproductive from the perspective of financial gain.<br /><br />This is why we ultimately decided that this trader's activity was simply a form of support to the campaign. While four million dollars is a fortune for most of us, it is less than the cost of making and airing a primetime commercial in a major media market. In the age of multi-billion dollar political campaigns, it really is a drop in the bucket. Even if the impact on perceptions was small, it's not clear to me that there was an alternative use of this money at this late stage that would have had a greater impact. Certainly television commercials had been largely tuned out by this point.<br /><br />It's important to keep in mind that attempts at manipulation notwithstanding, real money peer-to-peer prediction markets have been <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574072207000807\">very effective</a> in forecasting outcomes over the two decades in which they have been in use. Furthermore, as I hope my paper with David demonstrates, the simplicity of the binary option contract makes the data from such markets valuable for academic research. It is true that participation in these markets is a form of gambling, but that is also the case for many short-horizon traders in markets for more traditional assets, especially options, futures and swaps. The volume of speculation in such markets exceeds the demands for hedging by an order of magnitude. From a regulatory standpoint, there is really no rational basis for treating prediction markets differently.</div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the most casual observer of financial markets cannot fail to be impressed by the speed with which prices respond to new information. Markets may <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2327804\">overreact</a> at times but they seldom fail to react at all, and the time lag between the emergence of information and an adjustment in price is extremely short in the case of liquid securities such as common stock. <br /><br />Since all price movements arise from orders placed and executed, prices can respond to news only if there exist individuals in the economy who are alert to the arrival of new information and are willing to adjust positions on this basis. But this raises the question of how such \"information traders\" are able to find willing counterparties. After all, who in their right mind wants to trade with an individual having superior information?<br /><br />This kind of reasoning, when pushed to its logical limits, leads to some paradoxical conclusions. As shown by Aumann, two individuals who are commonly known to be rational, and who share a common prior belief about the likelihood of an event, cannot&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591\">agree to disagree</a>&nbsp;no matter how different their private information might be. That is, they can disagree only if this disagreement is itself not common knowledge. But the willingness of two risk-averse parties to enter opposite sides of a bet <i>requires</i> them to agree to disagree, and hence trade between risk-averse individuals with common priors is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022053182900461\">impossible</a>&nbsp;if they are commonly known to be rational.<br /><br />This may sound like an obscure and irrelevant result, since we see an enormous amount of trading in asset markets, but I find it immensely clarifying. It means that in thinking about trading we have to allow for either departures from (common knowledge of) rationality, or we have to drop the common prior hypothesis. And these two directions lead to different models of trading, with different and testable empirical predictions. <br /><br />The first approach, which maintains the common prior assumption but allows for traders with information-insensitive asset demands, was developed in a hugely influential <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210\">paper</a> by Albert Kyle. Such \"noise traders\" need not be viewed as entirely irrational; they may simply have urgent liquidity needs that require them to enter or exit positions regardless of price. Kyle showed that&nbsp;the presence of such traders induces market makers operating under competitive conditions to post bid and ask prices that could be accepted by any counterparty, including information traders. From this perspective, prices come to reflect information because informed parties trade with uninformed market makers, who compensate for losses on these trades with profits made in transactions with noise traders.<br /><br />An alternative approach, which does not require the presence of noise traders at all but drops the common prior assumption, can be traced to a wonderful (and even earlier)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">paper</a>&nbsp;by Harrison and Kreps. Here all traders have the same information at each point in time, but disagree about its implications for the value of securities. Trade occurs as new information arrives because individuals interpret this information differently. (Formally, they have heterogeneous priors and can therefore disagree even if their posterior beliefs are commonly known.) From this perspective prices respond to news because of heterogeneous <i>interpretations</i> of&nbsp;<i>public</i>&nbsp;information.<br /><br />Since these two approaches imply very different distributions of trading strategies, they are empirically distinguishable in principle. But identifying strategies from a sequence of trades is not an easy task. At a minimum, one needs transaction level data in which each trade is linked to a buyer and seller account, so that the evolution of individual portfolios can be tracked over time. From these portfolio adjustments one might hope to deduce the distribution of strategies in the trading population.<br /><br />In a <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1686004\">paper</a> that I have <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/02/market-ecology.html\">discussed</a> previously on this blog, Kirilenko, Kyle, Samadi and Tuzun have used transaction level data from the S&amp;P 500 E-Mini futures market to partition accounts into a small set of groups, thus mapping out an \"ecosystem'' in which different categories of traders \"occupy quite distinct, albeit overlapping, positions.'' Their concern was primarily with the behavior of high frequency traders both before and during the flash crash of May 6, 2010, especially in relation to liquidity provision. They do not explore the question of how prices come to reflect information, but in principle their data would allow them to do so. <br /><br />I have recently <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2322420\">posted</a>&nbsp;the first draft a paper, written jointly with David Rothschild, that looks at transaction level data from a very different source: Intrade's prediction market for the 2012 US presidential election. Anyone who followed this market over the course of the election cycle will know that prices were highly responsive to information, adjusting almost instantaneously to news. Our main goal in the paper was to map out an ecology of trading strategies and thereby gain some understanding of the process by means of which information comes to be reflected in prices. (We also wanted to evaluate&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">claims</a> made at the time of the election that a large trader was attempting to manipulate prices, but that's a topic for another post.)<br /><br />The data are extremely rich: for each transaction over the two week period immediately preceding the election, we know the price, quantity, time of trade, and aggressor side. Most importantly, we have unique identifiers for the buyer and seller accounts, which allows us to trace the evolution of trader portfolios and profits. No identities can be deduced from this data, but it is possible to make inferences about strategies from the pattern of trades.<br /><br />We focus on contracts referencing the two major party candidates, Obama and Romney. These contracts are structured as binary options, paying $10 if the referenced candidate wins the election and nothing otherwise. The data allows us to compute volume, transactions, aggression, holding duration, directional exposure, margin, and profit for each account. Using this, we are able to group traders into five categories, each associated with a distinct trading strategy. <br /><br />During our observational window there were about 84,000 separate transactions involving 3.5 million contracts and over 3,200 unique accounts. The single largest trader accumulated a net long Romney position of 1.2 million contracts (in part by shorting Obama contracts) and did this by engaging in about 13,000 distinct trades for a total loss in two weeks of about 4 million dollars. But this was not the most frequent trader: a different account was responsible for almost 34,000 transactions, which were clearly implemented algorithmically.<br /><br />One of our most striking findings is that 86% of traders, accounting for 52% of volume, never change the direction of their exposure even once. A further 25% of volume comes from 8% of traders who are strongly biased in one direction or the other. A handful of arbitrageurs account for another 14% of volume, leaving just 6% of accounts and 8% of volume associated with individuals who are unbiased in the sense that they are willing to take directional positions on either side of the market. This suggests to us that information finds its way into prices largely through the activities of traders who are biased in one direction or another, and differ with respect to their interpretations&nbsp;of public&nbsp;information rather than their differential access to private information.<br /><br />Prediction markets have historically generated forecasts that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574072207000807\">compete very effectively</a>&nbsp;with those of the best pollsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if most traders never change the direction of their exposure, how does information come to be reflected in prices? We argue that this occurs through something resembling the following process. Imagine a population of traders partitioned into two groups, one of which is predisposed to believe in an Obama victory while the other is predisposed to believe the opposite. Suppose that the first group has a net long position in the Obama contract while the second is short, and news arrives that suggests a decline in Obama's odds of victory (think of the first debate). Both groups revise their beliefs in response to the new information, but to different degrees. The latter group considers the news to be seriously damaging while the former thinks it isn't quite so bad. Initially both groups wish to sell, so the price drops quickly with very little trade since there are few buyers. But once the price falls far enough, the former group is now willing to buy, thus expanding their long position, while the latter group increases their short exposure. The result is that one group of traders ends up as net buyers of the Obama contract even when the news is bad for the incumbent, while the other ends up increasing short exposure even when the news is good. Prices respond to information, and move in the manner that one would predict, without any individual trader switching direction.<br /><br />This is a very special market, to be sure, more closely related to sports betting than to stock trading. But it does not seem implausible to us that similar patterns of directional exposure may also be found in more traditional and economically important asset markets. Especially in the case of consumer durables, attachment to products and the companies that make them is widespread. It would not be surprising if one were to find Apple or Samsung partisans among investors, just as one finds them among consumers. In this case one would expect to find a set of traders who increase their long positions in Apple even in the face of bad news for the company because they believe that the price has declined more than is warranted by the news. Whether or not such patterns exist is an empirical question that can only be settled with a transaction level analysis of trading data.<br /><br />If there's a message in all this, it is that markets aggregate not just information, but also fundamentally irreconcilable perspectives. Prices, as John Kay <a href=\"http://www.johnkay.com/2011/10/04/the-map-is-not-the-territory-an-essay-on-the-state-of-economics\">puts it</a>, \"are the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world.\" Some of the volatility that one observes in asset markets arises from changes in perspectives, which can happen independently of the arrival of information. This is why substantial \"corrections\" can <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)\">occur</a>&nbsp;even in the absence of significant news, and why stock prices <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1802789\">appear to</a> \"move too much to be justified by subsequent changes in dividends.\" What makes markets appear <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/invincible-markets-hypothesis.html\">invincible</a> is not the perfect aggregation of information that is sometimes attributed to them, but the sheer unpredictability of persuasion, exhortation, and social influence that can give rise to major shifts in the distribution of narratives.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Michael Lewis has written a riveting <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer\">report</a> on the trial, incarceration, release, and re-arrest of Sergey Aleynikov, once a star programmer at Goldman Sachs. It's a tale of a corporation coming down with all its might on a former employee who, when all is said an done, damaged the company only by deciding to take his prodigious talents elsewhere.<br /><br />As is always the case with Lewis, the narrative is brightly lit while the economic insights lie half-concealed in the penumbra of his prose.&nbsp;In this case he manages to shed light on the enormous divergence between the private and social costs of high frequency trading, as well as the madness of an intellectual property regime in which open-source code routinely finds its way into products that are then walled off from the public domain, violating the spirit if not the letter of the original open licenses.<br /><br />Aleynikov was hired by Goldman to help improve its relatively weak position in what is rather euphemistically called the market-making business. In principle, this is the business of offering quotes on both sides of an asset market in order that investors wishing to buy or sell will find willing counterparties. It was once a protected oligopoly in which specialists and dealers made money on substantial spreads between bid and ask prices, in return for which they provided some measure of price continuity.<br /><br />But these spreads have vanished over the past decade or so as the original market makers have been <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-market-makers.html\">displaced</a> by firms using algorithms to implement trading strategies that rely on rapid responses to incoming market data. The strategies are characterized by extremely short holding periods, limited intraday directional exposure, and very high volume. A key point in the transition was the adoption in 2007 of Regulation NMS (National Market System), which required that orders be routed to the exchange offering the best available price. This led to a proliferation of trading venues, since order flow could be attracted by price alone. Lewis describes the transition thus:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For reasons not entirely obvious... the new rule stimulated a huge amount of stock-market trading. Much of the new volume was generated not by old-fashioned investors but by extremely fast computers controlled by high-frequency-trading firms... Essentially, the more places there were to trade stocks, the greater the opportunity there was for high-frequency traders to interpose themselves between buyers on one exchange and sellers on another. This was perverse. The initial promise of computer technology was to remove the intermediary from the financial market, or at least reduce the amount he could scalp from that market. The reality has turned out to be a boom in financial intermediation and an estimated take for Wall Street of somewhere between $10 and $20 billion a year, depending on whose estimates you wish to believe. As high-frequency-trading firms aren’t required to disclose their profits... no one really knows just how much money is being made. But when a single high-frequency trader is paid $75 million in cash for a single year of trading (as was Misha Malyshev in 2008, when he worked at Citadel) and then quits because he is “dissatisfied,” a new beast is afoot.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The combination of new market rules and new technology was turning the stock market into, in effect, a war of robots. The robots were absurdly fast: they could execute tens of thousands of stock-market transactions in the time it took a human trader to blink his eye. The games they played were often complicated, but one aspect of them was simple and clear: the faster the robot, the more likely it was to make money at the expense of the relative sloth of others in the market.</blockquote>This last point is not quite right: speed alone can't get you very far unless you have an effective trading strategy. Knight Capital <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/928a1528-1859-11e2-80e9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2auUtXYXx\">managed to lose</a> almost a half billion dollars in less than an hour not because their algorithms were slow but because they did not faithfully execute the intended strategy. But what makes a strategy effective? The key, as Andrei Kirilenko and his co-authors discovered in their <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1686004\">study</a> of transaction-level data from the S&amp;P E-mini futures market, is predictive power<i>:</i><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">High Frequency Traders effectively predict and react to price changes... [they] are consistently profitable although they never accumulate a large net position...&nbsp;HFTs appear to trade in the same direction as the contemporaneous price and prices of the past five seconds. In other words, they buy... if the immediate prices are rising. However, after about ten seconds, they appear to reverse the direction of their trading... possibly due to their speed advantage or superior ability to predict price changes, HFTs are able to buy right as the prices are about to increase... They do not hold positions over long periods of time and revert to their target inventory level quickly... HFTs very quickly reduce their inventories by submitting marketable orders. They also aggressively trade when prices are about to change.&nbsp;</blockquote>Aleynikov was hired to speed up Goldman's systems, but he was largely unaware of (and seemed genuinely uninterested in) the details of their trading strategies. Here's Lewis again:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Oddly, he found his job more interesting than the stock-market trading he was enabling. “I think the engineering problems are much more interesting than the business problems,” he says... He understood that Goldman’s quants were forever dreaming up new trading strategies, in the form of algorithms, for the robots to execute, and that these traders were meant to be extremely shrewd. He grasped further that “all their algorithms are premised on some sort of prediction—predicting something one second into the future.”</blockquote>Effective prediction of price movements, even over such very short horizons, is not an easy task. It is essentially a problem of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/blame-instructions-not-machines.html\">information extraction</a>, based on rapid processing of incoming market data. The important point is that this information would have found its way into prices sooner or later in any case. By anticipating the process by a fraction of a second, the new market makers are able to generate a great deal of private value. But they are not responsible for the informational content of prices, and their profits, as well as the substantial cost of their operations, therefore must come at the expense of those investors who are actually trading on fundamental information.<br /><br />It is commonly argued that high frequency trading benefits institutional and retail investors because it has resulted in a sharp decline in bid-ask spreads. But this spread is a highly imperfect measure of the value to investors of the change in regime. What matters, especially for institutional investors placing large orders based on fundamental research, is not the marginal price at which the first few shares trade but the average price over the entire transaction. And if their private information is effectively extracted early in this process, the price impact of their activity will be greater, and price volatility will be higher in general.<br /><br />After all, it was a large order from an institutional investor <span id=\"goog_2107608598\"></span><span id=\"goog_2107608599\"></span><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\"></a>in the S&amp;P futures market that triggered the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8ee1a816-cd81-11df-9c82-00144feab49a.html#axzz2auUtXYXx\">flash crash</a>, sending indexes plummeting briefly, and individual securities trading at absurd prices. Accenture traded for a penny on the way down, and Sotheby's for a hundred thousand dollars a share on the bounce back.<br /><br />In evaluating the impact on investors of the change in market microstructure, it is worth keeping in mind&nbsp;<a href=\"http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/WSJ_2-07.pdf\">Bogle's Law</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It is the iron law of the markets, the undefiable rules of arithmetic: Gross return in the market, less the costs of financial intermediation, equals the net return actually delivered to market participants.</blockquote>This is just basic accounting, but often overlooked. If one wants to argue that the new organization of markets has been beneficial to investors, one needs to make the case that the costs of financial intermediation in the aggregate have gone down. Smaller bid-ask spreads have to be balanced against the massive increase in volume, the profits of the new market makers, and most importantly, the costs of high-frequency trading. These include nontrivial payments to highly skilled programmers and quants, as well as the costs of infrastructure, equipment, and energy. Lewis notes that&nbsp;the \"top high-frequency-trading firms chuck out their old gear and buy new stuff every few months,\" but these costs probably pale in comparison with those of cables facilitating&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-the-speed-of-light-is-too-slow\">rapid transmission</a>&nbsp;across large distances and the more mundane costs of cooling systems. All told, it is far from clear that the costs of financial intermediation have fallen in the aggregate.<br /><br />This post is already too long, but I'd like to briefly mention a quite different point that emerges from the Lewis article since it relates to a theme&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-intellectual-property-and-guard.html\">previously explored</a> on this blog. Aleynikov relied routinely on open-source code, which he modified and improved to meet the needs of the company. It is customary, if not mandatory, for these improvements to be released back into the public domain for use by others. But his attempts to do so were blocked:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Serge quickly discovered, to his surprise, that Goldman had a one-way relationship with open source. They took huge amounts of free software off the Web, but they did not return it after he had modified it, even when his modifications were very slight and of general rather than financial use. “Once I took some open-source components, repackaged them to come up with a component that was not even used at Goldman Sachs,” he says. “It was basically a way to make two computers look like one, so if one went down the other could jump in and perform the task.” He described the pleasure of his innovation this way: “It created something out of chaos. When you create something out of chaos, essentially, you reduce the entropy in the world.” He went to his boss, a fellow named Adam Schlesinger, and asked if he could release it back into open source, as was his inclination. “He said it was now Goldman’s property,” recalls Serge. “He was quite tense. When I mentioned it, it was very close to bonus time. And he didn’t want any disturbances.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Open source was an idea that depended on collaboration and sharing, and Serge had a long history of contributing to it. He didn’t fully understand how Goldman could think it was O.K. to benefit so greatly from the work of others and then behave so selfishly toward them... But from then on, on instructions from Schlesinger, he treated everything on Goldman Sachs’s servers, even if it had just been transferred there from open source, as Goldman Sachs’s property. (At Serge’s trial Kevin Marino, his lawyer, flashed two pages of computer code: the original, with its open-source license on top, and a replica, with the open-source license stripped off and replaced by the Goldman Sachs license.)</blockquote>This unwillingness to refresh the reservoir of ideas from which one drinks may be good for the firm but is clearly bad for the economy. As Michele Boldin and David Levine have strenuously <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=vdBtQgAACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">argued</a>, the rate of innovation in the software industry was dramatic prior to 1981 (before which software could not be patented):<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">What about the graphical user interfaces, the widgets such as buttons and icons, the compilers, assemblers, linked lists, object oriented programs, databases, search algorithms, font displays, word processing, computer languages – all the vast array of algorithms and methods that go into even the simplest modern program? ... Each and every one of these key innovations occurred prior to 1981 and so occurred without the benefit of patent protection. Not only that, had all these bits and pieces of computer programs been patented, as they certainly would have in the current regime, far from being enhanced, progress in the software industry would never have taken place. According to Bill Gates – hardly your radical communist or utopist – “If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today.”</blockquote>Vigorous innovation in open source development continues under the current system, but relies on a willingness to give back on the part of those who benefit from it, even if they are not legally mandated to do so. Aleynikov's natural instincts to reciprocate were blocked by his employer for reasons that are easy to understand but very difficult to sympathize with.<br /><br />Lewis concludes his piece by reflecting on Goldman's motives:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The real mystery, to the insiders, wasn’t why Serge had done what he had done. It was why Goldman Sachs had done what it had done. Why on earth call the F.B.I.? Why coach your employees to say what they need to say on a witness stand to maximize the possibility of sending him to prison? Why exploit the ignorance of both the general public and the legal system about complex financial matters to punish this one little guy? Why must the spider always eat the fly?</blockquote>The answer to this, I think, is contained in the company's response to Lewis, which is now appended to the article. The statement is impersonal, stern, vague and legalistic. It quotes an appeals court that overturned the verdict in a manner that suggests support for Goldman's position. Like the actions of the proverbial spider, it's a reflex, unconstrained by reflection or self-examination. Even if the management's primary fiduciary duty is to protect the interests of shareholders, this really does seem like a very shortsighted way to proceed.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br /><b>Update (August 6)</b>.

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among the many fascinating people currently affiliated with the Microsoft Research New York&nbsp;<a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/default.aspx\">lab</a>&nbsp;is <a href=\"http://www.katilondon.com/\">Kati London</a>,&nbsp;judged by MIT's Technology Review Magazine (2010) to be among the “Top 35 Innovators Under 35.” Through her involvement with the start-up <a href=\"http://areacodeinc.com/\">area/code</a>,&nbsp;Kati has developed games that transform the individuals who play them and the communities in which they reside.<br /><br />One such project is <a href=\"http://www.maconmoney.org/\">Macon Money</a>, an initiative involving the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20100142/\">Knight Foundation</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.collegehillmacon.com/\">College Hill Alliance</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;Macon, Georgia. This simple experiment, amazingly enough, sheds light on some fundamental questions in monetary economics, helps explain why conventional monetary policy via asset purchases has recently been so ineffective in stimulating the economy, suggests alternative approaches that might be substantially more effective, and speaks to the feasibility of the Chicago Plan (originally advanced by Henry Simons and Irving Fisher, and recently <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12202.pdf\">endorsed</a> by a couple of IMF economists) to abolish privately issued money. <br /><br />So what exactly was the Macon Money project? It began with a grant of $65,000 by the Knight Foundation, which was used to back the issue of bonds. These bonds were (literally) sliced in two and the halves were given away through various channels to residents of Macon. If a pair of individuals holding halves of the same bond could find each other, they were able to exchange the (now complete) bond for Macon Money, which could then be used to make expenditures at a variety of local businesses. These business were happy to accept Macon Money because it could be redeemed at par for US currency.<br /><br />The basic idea is described here:<br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"253\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/OT91aQTFHiY?rel=0\" width=\"450\"></iframe> </div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>The demographics of the participant population, the distribution of expenditures, and the strategies used by players to find their \"other halves\" are all described in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/macon-money-game-evaluation-summary/\">evaluation summary</a>.&nbsp;The project had the twin goals of building social capital and stimulating economic development. Although few enduring ties were created among the players, participation did create a sense of excitement about Macon and greater optimism about its future. And participating businesses managed to find a new pool of repeat customers.<br /><br />Macon money was a fiscal intervention (an injection of funds into the locality) accomplished using the device of privately issued money convertible at par. There was a temporary increase in the local money supply which was extinguished when businesses redeemed their notes. An interesting thought experiment is to imagine what would have happened if, instead of being convertible at par, businesses could only convert Macon Money into currency at a small discount.<br /><br />Businesses that accept credit card payments are exactly in this situation, facing a haircut of 1-3 percent when they convert credit card payments into cash. Most businesses that participated in the original experiment would therefore likely continue to participate in the modified one. After all, businesses involved in Groupon campaigns accept a 75% haircut once Groupon takes its share of the discounted price.<br /><br />But there is one critically important difference between Macon Money and a credit card payment: the former is <i>negotiable</i> while the latter is not. That is, instead of being redeemed at a small discount, Macon Money could be spent at par. If enough businesses were participating, it would make sense for each one to spend rather than redeem its receipts. The privately issued money would therefore remain in circulation.<br /><br />What about a business that had no interest in spending its receipts on locally provided goods and services? Even in this case, there would be better alternatives to redeeming at a discount. For instance, if the discount were 3%, there would be room for the emergence of a local intermediary who offered cash at a more attractive 2% discount to the business, and then sold Macon Money at 1% below par to those who did wish to spend locally. Again, the privately issued money would remain in circulation.<br /><br />As a result, the local money supply would have grown not just for a brief period, but indefinitely. The discount itself would allow for more money to be injected for any given amount of backing funds. And as long as convertibility was never in doubt, substantially more money could be issued than the funds earmarked to back it.<br /><br />This simple thought experiment tells us something about policy. Macon Money provided an injection of liquidity that improved the balance sheets of those who managed to secure bonds. This allowed for an increase in aggregate expenditure, and given the slack in local productive capacity, also an increase in production.<br /><br />It was expansionary monetary policy, but quite different from the kind of policy pursued by the Federal Reserve. The Fed expands the money supply by buying securities, which leads to a change in the composition of the asset side of individual balance sheets. Higher asset prices (and correspondingly lower interest rates) are supposed to stimulate demand through increased borrowing at more attractive rates. But in a balance sheet recession, distressed borrowers are unwilling to take on more debt and the stimulative effects of such a policy are accordingly <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/06/fighting-over-claims.html\">muted</a>. This is why calls for an <a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/918.html\">alternative</a> <a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/\">approach</a> to monetary policy make analytical sense.<br /><br />Furthermore, the fact that Macon Money was accepted only locally meant that it could not be used for imports from other locations. The monetary stimulus was therefore not subject to the kinds of demand leakages that would arise from the issue of generalized fiat money.<br /><br />Finally, the project provided a very clear illustration of the difficulty of <a href=\"http://slackwire.blogspot.com/2012/11/imf-abolish-debt.html\">abolishing</a>&nbsp;privately issued money. Unless one were to prevent all creditworthy institutions from issuing convertible liabilities, it would be virtually impossible to halt the use of such liabilities as media of exchange. Put differently, we are always going to have a shadow banking system. But what the Macon Money initiative shows is that the creative and judicious use of private money, backed by creditworthy foundations, can revitalize communities currently operating well below their productive potential. Whether this can be done in a scalable way, with some government involvement and oversight to prevent abuse, remains unclear. But surely the idea deserves a closer look?<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br />Update. Another important feature of Macon Money is the fact that it cannot be used to pay down debt unless the creditors are themselves local. This means that even highly indebted households will either spend it, or pay down debt by selling their notes to someone who will. If increasing economic activity is the goal, this is vastly superior to disbursements of cash.<br /><br />Joseph Cotterill <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/04/25/1476452/the-closer-226/\">asks</a> (rhetorically) whether Macon Money is the anti-Bitcoin. Exactly right, and very well put.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br /><a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/\">Ashwin Parameswaran</a>&nbsp;has sent in the following via email (posted with permission):<br /><blockquote>Just read your post on Macon money - fascinating experiment and your thought experiment on how it could stay in circulation was equally interesting. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>On the thought experiment, there's also a possibility that if Macon money can only be converted into currency at a discount then Macon money itself would be valued at a discount. Coming back to your example on credit cards, this often happens in countries where retailers can get away with it. Lots of small retailers in India offer cash discounts even when they give you a receipt i.e. its not just a tax dodge. Many retailers in the UK simply don't accept Amex cards because of the size of the haircut they impose. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>On the broader subject of imagining various types of money, this is probably closest to private banking money whereas Bitcoin is by design closest to gold. Another experiment is the idea of pure local credit money without even the intermediation of a private bank-like entity which seems to be the idea behind <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_monetary_system\">Ripple</a> although the current implementation seems to be a little different. Over the last year I've done a lot of reading on 14th-17th century English history of credit/money and its almost universally accepted that most of the local money worked largely with such peer-to-peer credit systems with gold perennially being in short supply. The section of <a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/10/17/monetary-and-fiscal-economics-for-a-near-credit-economy/\">this post</a> titled 'Interest-Bearing Money: Debt as Money' summarises some of my reading. The first half of Carl Wennerlind’s book ‘Casualties of Credit’ is excellent and has some great references in this area.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>You could see the entire arc of the last 400 years as an exercise in making these private webs of credit more stable. So peer-to-peer credit became private banking. Then comes the lender of last resort and fiat money so that the LOLR is not constrained. At the same time we make the collateral safer and safer - govt bonds during the English Financial revolution, now MBS, bank debt etc. The irony is that now banks finance everything except what they started out financing which is SME bills of exchange/invoices. Partly the reasons are regulatory but fundamentally the risk is too idiosyncratic and \"micro\" in an environment where macro risks are backstopped.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>In fact here in the UK there's a lot of non-bank and even peer to peer interest in some of these spaces. See <a href=\"http://marketinvoice.com/\">this one</a> for invoice financing (the interest is partly because peer-to-peer lending in the UK has almost no regulatory burden, not regulated by the FSA at all). In a way this is just a modern-day reconstruction of the same system that existed in 16th-17th century England - peer-to-peer webs of credit. But with the critical difference that the system is not as elastic and doesn't really need to be. There are enough individuals, insurers etc who are more than capable of taking on the real risk and giving up their own purchasing power in the interim period for an adequate return.&nbsp;</blockquote>Lots to think about here. Briefly, on the issue of Macon Money being valued at a discount, this seems unlikely to me except in a secondary market for conversion into cash. Unlike credit card receipts, Macon Money is negotiable, and as long as it can be converted into goods and services at par it will be valued at par by those who plan to spend it. Of course there may be an equilibrium in which vendors themselves only accept it at a discount, which then becomes a self-sustaining practice. This would be equivalent to a selective increase in price, possible only if there is insufficient competition.<br /><br />Here's more from Ashwin:<br /><blockquote>Another tangential point on the peer-to-peer credit networks in 16th century England was that although they had the downside of being perpetually fragile (there are accounts of middle-class traders feeling permanently insecure because they were always entrenched in long webs of credit), this credit money could not be hoarded by anyone. In this sense it really was the anti-gold/bitcoin. I wonder what you would need to do to Macon Money to protect against the potential leakage of being just hoarded as a store of value. This is of course what people like Silvio Gesell were concerned with (there are some excellent comments by anonymous commenter 'K' on <a href=\"http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/02/money-as-store-of-wealth.html\">this Nick Rowe post</a> on the paradox of hoarding). I think there's merit to a modern money that could be a medium of exchange but could not serve as a store of wealth. I often think about what such a money could look like but at the end of the day we really need experiments and trials to figure out what could work.&nbsp;</blockquote>Agreed. </div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">When Intrade halted trading abruptly on March 10, my <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-prediction-market-mystery.html\">initial reaction</a> was that the company had commingled member funds with its own, MF Global style, in violation of its <a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/aav2/safeFunds.html\">Trust and Security Statement</a>. I suspected that these funds were then dissipated (or embezzled), leaving the firm unable to honor requests for redemption.<br /><br />The latest <a href=\"https://www.intrade.com/v4/home/\">announcement</a> from the company confirms that something along these lines did, in fact, occur:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We have now concluded the initial stages of our investigations about the financial status of the Company, and it appears that the Company is in a cash “shortfall” position of approximately US $700,000 when comparing all cash on hand in Company and Member bank accounts with Member account balances on the Exchange system.</blockquote>A shortfall of this kind could not have emerged if member funds had been kept separate from company funds. As it stands, the exchange is technically insolvent and faces imminent liquidation.<br /><br />But the company is looking for a way to \"rectify this cash shortfall position\" in hopes of resuming operations and returning to viability. It has requested members with large accounts to formally agree to allow the exchange to hold on to some portion of their funds indefinitely:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The Company has now contacted all members with account balances greater than $1000, and proposed a “forbearance” arrangement between these members and the Company, which if sufficient members agree, would allow the Company to remain solvent...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">By Tuesday, April 16, 2013, we expect to be able to inform our members if sufficient forbearance has been achieved. If so, we will then resume limited operations of the Company and we will be able to process requests for withdrawals as agreed. If sufficient forbearance has not been achieved, it seems extremely likely that the Company will be forced into liquidation.</blockquote>So traders find themselves in a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/07/greek-games.html\">strategic situation</a> similar to that faced by holders&nbsp;of Greek sovereign debt a couple of years ago.&nbsp;If enough members accept the proposed haircut, then the remaining members (who do not accept) will be able to withdraw their funds. The company might then be able to resume operations and eventually allow unrestricted withdrawals. But if enough forbearance is not forthcoming, the company will be forced into immediate liquidation.<br /><br />What should one do under such circumstances? As Jeff Ely might say,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cheaptalk.org/2012/04/20/consider-the-equilibrium-17/\">consider the equilibrium</a>. &nbsp;The best case outcome from the perspective of any one member would be immediate reimbursement in full. But this can only happen if the member in question denies the company's request, while enough other members agree to it. As long as members can't coordinate their actions, and each believes that his own choice is unlikely to be decisive, it makes no sense for any of them to accept the haircut. Liquidation under these circumstances seems inevitable.<br /><br />On the other hand, what choice do members really have? Although their funds are senior to all other claims on the firm's assets, the cash shortfall will prevent such claims from being honored in full. And since members are scattered across multiple jurisdictions and lack the power to coordinate their response, even partial recovery through litigation seems improbable. Facing little or no prospect of getting anything back anytime soon, some might choose to roll the dice one last time.<br /><br />The obvious lesson in all this is that in the absence of vigorous oversight, \"trust and security\" statements can't really be trusted to provide security.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

The event included moving recollections from members of his family, as well as <a href=\"http://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/Remembering-Albert-Hirschman.pdf\">tributes</a> by Joan Scott, Jeremy Adelman, Michael Walzer, Amartya Sen, Annie Cot, Wolf Lepenies, William Sewell, James Wolfensohn, and Robbert Dijkgraaf. Fernando Henrique Cardoso could not attend but sent written remarks that were read out by Adelman. I'll update this post with links to the text or video of other speeches should any become available.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br />It’s an enormous privilege to have been invited to speak at this event in memory of Albert Hirschman. Unlike most of the other speakers here, I knew Albert only from a distance, based largely on his books and interviews. I met him in person just once, though I was fortunate enough to get to know Sarah a little during my year at the Institute.<br /><br />Since my connection to Albert was largely through his writing, I’d like to speak about his love of language, his gift for expression, and his approach to the written word. To Albert, words were not merely vehicles for the transmission of ideas—they were objects to be played with and molded into structures in which one could perpetually take delight.<br /><br />In 1993 Albert gave an interview to a group of Italian writers, which he later translated into English and published under the title <i>Crossing Boundaries</i>. I’d like to quote a segment of that interview that sums up very nicely both his playful relationship with language and the great originality of his ideas. This is what he said:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">I enjoy playing with words, inventing new expressions. I believe there is much more wisdom in words than we normally assume.... Here is an example. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">One of my recent antagonists, Mancur Olson, uses the expression \"logic of collective action\" in order to demonstrate the illogic of collective action, that is, the virtual unlikelihood that collective action can ever happen. At some point I was thinking about the fundamental rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence and that beautiful expression of American freedom as \"the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"I noted how, in addition to the pursuit of happiness, one might also underline the importance of the <i>happiness of pursuit</i>, which is precisely the felicity of taking part in collective action. I simply was happy when that play on words occurred to me.</blockquote>This idea of the <i>happiness of pursuit</i>, the pleasure that one takes in collective action, was to be a central theme in his masterpiece <i>Exit, Voice and Loyalty</i>, published in 1970. Two centuries earlier, Adam Smith had spoken of our propensity to \"truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.\" Albert Hirschman spoke instead of a propensity to protest, complain, and generally \"kick up a fuss.\" This articulation of discontent he called <i>Voice</i>.<br /><br />Albert believed that voice was an important factor in arresting and reversing decline in firms, organizations, and states. Economists to that point had focused on a very different mechanism, namely desertion or <i>exit</i>, and had argued that greater competition, in the form of greater ease of exit, was a beneficial force in maintaining high levels of organizational performance.<br /><br />Albert pointed out that there was a trade-off between exit and voice; that greater ease of exit could result in a stifling of voice as the individuals most inclined to protest and complain chose to depart instead. He also observed that <i>loyalty</i>, provided that it was not completely blind and uncritical, could serve to delay exit and thus create the space for voice to do its work.<br /><br />What Albert did in <i>Exit, Voice and Loyalty</i> was nothing less than to reunite two disciplines, economics and political science, which had once been closely entwined but had drifted far apart over time. And he did this not by exporting the methods of economics to the analysis of politics, as others had done, but by emphasizing the importance of political activity within the economic sphere.<br /><br />This kind of interdisciplinarity permeated all of Albert’s work. He described the idea of <i>trespassing</i> as \"basic to his thinking.\" Crossing boundaries came naturally to him; he was too restless and playful to be confined to a single discipline. He was also an intellectual rebel, eager to question conventional wisdom whenever he found it wanting. In fact, he did so even when the conventional wisdom had been established by his own prior work. He referred to this as a propensity to <i>self-subversion</i>, which he called a \"permanent trait of his intellectual personality.\"<br /><br />I recall vividly and fondly my very first contact with Albert’s work. I had just begun graduate school, having never previously studied economics, and found myself in a course on the History of Economic Thought with the legendary Robert Heilbroner. It was Heilbroner’s book <i>The Worldly Philosophers</i> that had steered me to economics in the first place. And there on his syllabus, alongside Smith and Ricardo and Malthus, was Albert’s book <i>The Passions and the Interests</i>.<br /><br />I recently went back and read this extraordinary book for a second time. The twentieth anniversary edition has a foreword by Amartya Sen, who considers it to be \"among the finest\" of Albert’s writings. Albert himself, in the preface to this edition, notes that it’s the one book that never fell victim to his propensity to self-subversion.<br /><br />There’s a memorable passage in the book where Albert discusses Adam Smith’s claim that \"order and good government\" came to England as the unintended consequence of a growing taste for manufactured luxuries among the feudal elite. They \"bartered their whole power and authority,\" says Smith, for the \"gratification of… vanities… for trinkets and baubles, better fit to be the playthings of children than the serious pursuits of man.\" Having squandered their wealth in this manner, they could no longer support their vast armies of retainers, and became incapable of \"disturbing the peace\" or \"interrupting the regular execution of justice.\"<br /><br />But Albert was skeptical that the feudal lords had been quite so blind to their long-term interests. He felt that Smith, always eager to uncover the unintended effects of human action, had overreached this time. And he expressed this thought as follows:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">One cannot help feeling that in this particular instance, Smith overplayed his Invisible Hand.</blockquote>I can just imagine the smile that spread across Albert’s face when he came up with that turn of phrase.<br /><br />Albert’s work was expansive and visionary, bold and audacious, breathtakingly original and creative. But most of all, it was playful and gently irreverent. He demonstrated to us, by his own example, the happiness of <i>intellectual</i> pursuit. For that, more than anything else, I’ll always be grateful.</div><div><br /></div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href .

Visitors to the <a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/v4/home/\">site</a> were greeted with the following mysterious message (emphasis added):<br /><blockquote>With sincere regret we must inform you that due to circumstances recently discovered we must immediately cease trading activity on www.intrade.com.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>These circumstances require immediate further investigation, and may include <i>financial irregularities</i> which in accordance with Irish law oblige the directors to take the following actions:<br /><ul><li>Cease exchange trading on the website immediately.</li></ul><ul><li>Settle all open positions and calculate the settled account value of all Member accounts immediately.</li></ul><ul><li><i>Cease all banking transactions for all existing Company accounts</i> immediately.</li></ul>During the <i>upcoming weeks</i>, we will investigate these circumstances further and determine the necessary course of action.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>To mitigate any <i>further risk</i> to members’ accounts, we have closed and settled all open contracts at fair market value as of the close of business on March 10, 2013, in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of our customers’ use of the website. You may view your account details and settled account balances by logging into the website.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>At this time and until further notice, <i>it is not possible to make any payments</i> to members in accordance with their settled account balance until the investigations have concluded.</blockquote>Translation: all open contracts have been closed out at current prices, account balances now reflect only cash positions, and no withdrawals can be made until further notice. Not a penny will be paid out to any member for the time being, no matter how large their cash balance may be. <br /><br />What on earth is going on? My <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/310960596004786176\">best guess</a> is that the margin posted by traders was not held, as it should be, in segregated accounts separate from company funds. When bets are made on this market, both parties must post margin equal to their worst-case loss, so that neither is subject to counterparty risk. In effect, each party is taking a position against the exchange, but these positions are exactly offsetting so the exchange bears no risk. To ensure that all promised payments can be made, these funds must be held in the form of cash, insured deposits, or safe dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bills. They cannot be invested in risky assets, and cannot be used for the payment of salaries or expenses.<br /><br />All this was made clear in the exchange's so-called <a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/aav2/safeFunds.html\">Trust and Security Statement</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Segregated Funds</b>: Your funds are held in segregated accounts with banks in Ireland, and are segregated from Intrade's own corporate funds.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><b>Safer by Design</b>: If the Dow Jones crashes, the New York Stock Exchange doesn't go bankrupt. In the same way, intrade doesn't lose money when an unusual result arises. Whenever you trade, intrade will 'freeze' sufficient money in your account to cover your potential losses. If you lose, we simply transfer the already frozen money from your account to a winning customer account. If you win, we pay your winnings from a losing customer account.</blockquote>While this design is safe in theory, there was no mechanism in place to ensure that these commitments would, in fact, be met. When Intrade closed its doors to US residents in November, it did so in response to an action by the CFTC. I <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/death-of-prediction-market.html\">wondered</a> at the time whether there was regulatory concern about the segregation of funds:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Even though the exchange claims to keep this margin in segregated accounts, separate from company funds, there is always the possibility that its deposits are not fully insured and could be lost if the Irish banking system were to collapse. These losses would ultimately be incurred by traders, who would then have very limited legal recourse.</blockquote>Similar concerns were raised in an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennockd/status/273568551376404480\">exchange</a> with Dave Pennock on twitter. I thought at the time that the biggest risk came from failures in the Irish banking system, and discounted the possibility that trader margin could be deliberately co-mingled with company funds, invested in risky securities, or simply embezzled. This may have been too optimistic a view, especially given the precedent of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/03/us-mfglobal-funds-idUSTRE7B203J20111203\">MF Global</a>.<br /><br />If some funds have been diverted or lost, then traders face the prospect of receiving less than par on their cash balances when withdrawals eventually resume. And even if they do not suffer eventual losses, the fact that their funds are frozen for an extended period itself imposes an opportunity cost. If there's a lesson in all this, it is that markets cannot exist without trust, and trust cannot be sustained indefinitely without some sort of oversight and regulation. <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/reputational-capital-and-incentives-in.html\">Reputational effects</a> alone are simply not enough.</div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the many benefits of visiting <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/default.aspx\">Microsoft Research</a> this semester is that I get to attend some interesting talks by computer scientists working with social and economic data. One in particular this week turned out to be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/technology/groupon-dismisses-its-chief-andrew-mason.html\">extremely topical</a>. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2369v1.pdf\">paper</a>&nbsp;was on \"The Groupon Effect on Yelp Ratings\" and it was presented by Giorgios <strike>Servas</strike> Zervas.<br /><div><br /></div>The starting point of the analysis was this: the Yelp ratings of businesses who launch Groupon campaigns suffer a sharp and immediate decline which recovers only gradually over time, with peristent effects lasting for well over a year. The following chart sums it up:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCLzfJbJSfQ/US98aF1-CQI/AAAAAAAAB6k/8WaXZNKuK6E/s1600/GrouponYelp.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCLzfJbJSfQ/US98aF1-CQI/AAAAAAAAB6k/8WaXZNKuK6E/s400/GrouponYelp.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />The trend line is a 30 day moving average, but re-initialized on the launch date (so the first few points after this date average just a few observations). There is a second sharp decline after about 180 days, as the coupons are about to expire. The chart also shows the volume of ratings, which surges after the launch date. Part of the surge is driven by raters who explicitly reference Groupon (the darker volume bars). But not all Groupon users identify as such in their reviews, and about half the increase in ratings volume comes from ratings that do not reference Groupon.<br /><br />As is typical of computer scientists working with social data, the number of total observations is enormous. Almost 17,000 daily deals from over 5,000 businesses in 20 cities over a six month period are included, along with review histories for these businesses both during and prior to the observational window. In addition, the entire review histories of those who rated any of these businesses during the observational window were collected, expanding the set of reviews to over 7 million, and covering almost a million distinct businesses in all.<br /><br />So what accounts for the damage inflicted on Yelp ratings by Groupon campaigns? The authors explore several hypotheses. Groupon users could be especially harsh reviewers regardless of whether or not they are rating a Groupon business. Businesses may be overwhelmed by the rise in demand, resulting in a decline in quality for all customers. The service provided to Groupon users may be worse than that provided to customers paying full price. Customer preferences may be poorly matched to businesses they frequent using Groupons. Or the ratings prior to the campaign may be artificially inflated by fake positive reviews, which get swamped by more authentic reviews after the campaign. All of these seem plausible and consistent with anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />One hypothesis that is rejected quite decisively by the data is that Groupon users tend to be harsh reviewers in general. To address this, the authors looked at the review histories of those who identified Groupon use for the businesses in the observational window. Most of these prior reviews do not involve Groupon use, which allows for a direct test of the hypothesis that these raters were harsh in general. It turns out that they were not. Groupon users tend to write detailed and informative reviews that are more likely to be considered valuable, cool and funny by their peers. But they do not rate businesses without Groupon campaigns more harshly than other reviewers.<br /><br />What about the hypothesis of businesses being overwhelmed by the rise in demand? Since only about half the surge in reviews comes from those who explicitly reference Groupon, the remaining ratings pool together non-Groupon customers with those who don't reveal Groupon use. This makes a decline in ratings by the latter group hard to interpret. <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/jcl/\">John Langford</a> (who was in the audience) noted that if the entire surge in reviews could be attributed to Groupon users, and if undeclared and declared users had the same ratings on average, then one could infer the effect of the campaign on the ratings of regular customers. This seems worth pursuing.<br /><br />Anecdotal evidence on discriminatory treatment of customers paying discounted prices is plentiful (the authors mention the notorious <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/11/pf/groupon_ftd_deal_backlash/index.htm\">FTD flowers case</a>&nbsp;for instance). If mistreatment of coupon-carrying customers by a few bad apples were bringing down the ratings average, then a campaign should result in a more negatively skewed distribution of ratings relative to the pre-launch baseline. The authors look for this shift in skewness and find some evidence for it, but the effect is not large enough to account for the entire drop in the average rating.<br /><br />To test the hypothesis that ratings prior to a campaign are artificially inflated by fake or purchased reviews, the authors look at the rate at which reviews by self-identified Groupon users are filtered, compared with the corresponding rate for reviews that make no mention of Groupon. (Yelp allows filtered reviews to be seen, though they are harder to access and are not used in the computation of ratings). Reviews referencing Groupon are filtered much less often, suggesting that they are more likely to be authentic. If Yelp's filtering algorithm is lenient enough to let a number of fake reviews through, then the post-campaign ratings will be not just more numerous but also more authentic and less glowing.<br /><br />Finally, consider the possibility of a mismatch between the preferences of Groupon users and the businesses whose offers they accept. To look for evidence of this, the authors consider the extent to which reviews associated with Groupon use reveal experimentation on the part of the consumer. This is done by comparing the business category and location to the categories and locations in the reviewer's history. Experimentation is said to occur when the business category or zipcode differs from any in the reviewer's history. The data provide strong support for the hypothesis that individuals are much more likely to be experimenting in this sense when using a Groupon than when not. And such experimentation could plausibly lead to a greater incidence of disappointment.<br /><br />This point deserves further elaboration. Even without experimentation on categories or locations, an individual who accepts a daily deal has a lower anticipated valuation for the product or service than someone who pays full price. Even if the expectations of both types of buyers are met, and each feels that they have gotten what they paid for, there will be differences in the ratings they assign. To take an extreme case, if the product were available for free, many buyers would emerge who consider the product essentially worthless, and would rate it accordingly even if their expectations are met.<br /><br />There may be a lesson here for companies contemplating Groupon campaigns. Perhaps the Yelp rating would suffer less damage if the discount itself were not as steep. At present there is very little variation in discounts, which are mostly clustered around 50%. So there's no way to check whether smaller discounts actually result in better ratings relative to larger discounts. But it certainly seems worth exploring, at least for businesses that depend on strong ratings to thrive.<br /><br />The Groupon strategy of prioritizing growth above earnings had been <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/04/groupon_earnings_report_the_shaky_theory_behind_the_company_s_business_model_.html\">criticized</a> on the grounds that there are few barriers to entry in this industry, and no network externalities that can protect an incumbent from competition. But if the link between campaigns and ratings can't be broken, there may be deeper problems with the business model than a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/technology/groupon-dismisses-its-chief-andrew-mason.html\">change of leadership</a>&nbsp;or strategy can solve.</div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm on leave this semester, visiting Microsoft Research's recently launched New York&nbsp;<a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/default.aspx\">lab</a>. It's a lively and stimulating place and there are a number of interesting projects underway. In this post I'd like to report on one of these, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.predictwise.com/\">prediction market</a>&nbsp;developed by a team composed of David Pennock, David Rothschild, Miroslav Dudik, Jennifer Vaughan, and Sébastien Lahaie. <br /><br />This market is very different from peer-to-peer real money prediction markets such as IEM or Intrade, in that individual participants take positions not against each other but against an algorithmic market maker that adjusts prices in response to orders placed. Furthermore, a broad and complex range of events are priced, orders of arbitrary size can be met, and consistency across prices is maintained by the immediate identification and exploitation of arbitrage opportunities.<br /><br />The market for <a href=\"http://wiseq.predictwise.com/2013oscars/index.php\">Oscar predictions</a> is now live,&nbsp;and it's easy to participate. You can log in with a google account (or facebook or twitter) or create a new PredictWise account. You'll be credited with 1000 points which may be used to buy a range of contracts. These include contracts on <a href=\"http://wiseq.predictwise.com/2013oscars/oscars_winners.php\">simple events</a>, such as \"Lincoln to win Best Picture.\" But they also include events that reference <a href=\"http://wiseq.predictwise.com/2013oscars/oscars_films.php\">multiple categories</a>: you can bet on the event \"Argo to win Best Picture and Daniel Day-Lewis to win Best Actor in a Leading Role,\" or \"Zero Dark Thirty to win between 3 and 5 awards\" for example.<br /><br />All of these contracts are priced but the price is sensitive to order size. For small orders one can buy at the currently posted odds. &nbsp;For instance, for \"Lincoln to win Best Picture,\" current odds are 10.4%, so an expenditure of 0.104 units will return 1 unit if the event occurs:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ha4OkFAfRE/USPeD3_zQSI/AAAAAAAAB6M/gngZJHZRFp8/s1600/Prediction+Market.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"337\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ha4OkFAfRE/USPeD3_zQSI/AAAAAAAAB6M/gngZJHZRFp8/s400/Prediction+Market.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />But placing a larger order, say for 1.04 units, returns less than 10:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zCDqFSJ4aGQ/USPeJUJaiCI/AAAAAAAAB6U/V7n2lyFPEoo/s1600/Prediction+Market+2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"338\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zCDqFSJ4aGQ/USPeJUJaiCI/AAAAAAAAB6U/V7n2lyFPEoo/s400/Prediction+Market+2.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />The functional relationship between the price and quantity vectors is deterministic and satisfies three conditions: (i) the purchase of a contract (or portfolio) raises its price smoothly, (ii) this happens in such a manner as to bound the maximum possible loss incurred by the market maker, no matter how large the order size, (iii) contracts that are obvious complements, such as \"Lincoln to win Best Picture\" and \"Lincoln not to win Best Picture\" have prices that sum to 1. <br /><br />What makes this market interesting is that the algorithm ensures consistency in prices across linked contracts, quickly exploiting and eliminating any arbitrage opportunities than might arise. Some of these arbitrage conditions are not immediately transparent, as the following simplified example reveals.<br /><br />Suppose that there were only two Oscar categories (Best Picture and Best Director) and consider the following seven events:<br /><ol><li>Lincoln to win Best Picture</li><li>Lincoln not to win Best Picture</li><li>Lincoln to win Best Director</li><li>Lincoln not to win Best Director</li><li>Lincoln to win 0 Oscars</li><li>Lincoln to win 1 Oscar</li><li>Lincoln to win 2 Oscars</li></ol>Let <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;denote the price of contract <i>i</i>, where <i>i</i> = 1,...,7, where each contract pays out one dollar if the event in question occurs. Clearly we must have<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>1<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= &nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>4</sub>&nbsp;= 1,&nbsp;</div><br />otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity. Similarly, we must have<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>5<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>7</sub>&nbsp;= 1.&nbsp;</div><br />Price adjustments in response to orders are such that these equalities are continuously maintained.   Somewhat less obviously, we must also have<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>1<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;= &nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+ 2<i>p</i><sub>7</sub>.</div><br />If this condition were violated, then one could construct a portfolio that guaranteed a positive profit no matter what the eventual outcome may be. To see this, suppose that prices were such that<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>1<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+ 2<i>p</i><sub>7</sub>.</div><br />In this case, the following portfolio would yield a risk-free profit: buy one unit each of contracts 2, 4, and 6, and two units of contract 7. This would cost<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">(1<i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;p</i><sub>1</sub>) + (1 -&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>) + &nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+ 2<i>p</i><sub>7<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>&nbsp;&lt; 2.</div><br />The payoff from this portfolio would be exactly 2, no matter how things turn out. If Lincoln wins no Oscars then contracts 2 and 4 each pay out one unit, if it wins one Oscar then contract 6 pays out a unit, in addition to either contract 2 or contract 4, and if it wins two Oscars then each of the two units of contract 7 pays out.<br /><br />In reality, there are more than two categories for which Lincoln has been nominated, and the arbitrage conditions are accordingly more complex. The point is that whenever trades occur that cause these conditions to be violated, the algorithm itself begins to execute additional trades that exploit the opportunity, shifting prices in such a manner as to restore parity. In peer-to-peer markets this activity is left to the participants themselves; trader developed algorithms have been in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/10/algorithms-arbitrage-and-overreaction.html\">widespread use</a>&nbsp;on Intrade for instance.<br /><br />One problem with peer-to-peer markets is that only a few contracts can have significant liquidity, and complex combinations of events will therefore not be transparently and consistently priced. But the design described here allows for the consistent valuation of any combination of events, at the cost of subjecting the market maker to potential loss. The pricing function is designed to place a bound on this loss, but it cannot be avoided entirely because market participants have access to information that the market maker lacks.<br /><br />Could this be a template for markets on compound events in the future? It certainly seems possible, if the internally generated arbitrage profits are large enough to compensate for the information disadvantage faced by the market maker. But at the moment this is a research initiative, focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the mechanism for aggregating distributed information. This goal is best served by broad participation and better data, so if you have a few minutes to spare before the Oscar winners are announced on Sunday, why not <a href=\"http://wiseq.predictwise.com/2013oscars/index.php\">log in</a> and place a few (hypothetical) bets?</div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Albert Hirschman, among the greatest of social scientists, has died.&nbsp;He was truly one of a kind: always&nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=dgc5AAAAIAAJ\">trespassing</a>, relentlessly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=LlvD47cU-qAC\">self-subversive</a>, and never constrained by disciplinary <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=VDHlOwAACAAJ\">boundaries</a>.<br /><br />Hirschman's life was as <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/04/self-subversion-of-albert-hirschman.html\">extraordinary</a> as his work. Born in Berlin in 1915,&nbsp;he was educated in French and German. He would later gain fluency in Italian, then Spanish and English. He fled Berlin for Paris in 1933, and joined the French resistance in 1939. Fearful of being shot as a traitor by advancing German forces, he took on a new identity as a Frenchman, Albert Hermant. In 1941 he migrated to the United States, met and married Sarah Hirschman, joined the US Army, and soon found himself back in Europe as part of the war effort. After the end of hostilities he was involved in the development of the Marshall Plan, and subsequently spent four years in Bogotá where many of his ideas on economic development took shape. He and Sarah were married for more than seven decades; she died in January of this year.<br /><br />Not only did Hirschman write several brilliant books in what was his fourth or fifth language, he also entertained himself with the invention of palindromes. Many of these were collected together in a book, <i>Senile Lines</i> by <i>Dr. Awkward</i>, which he presented to his daughter Katya. Forms of expression mattered to him as much as the ideas themselves. In opposition to Mancur Olson, he believed that collective action was an activity that came naturally to us humans, and was thrilled to find that one could invert a phrase in the declaration of independence to express this inclination as \"the happiness of pursuit.\"<br /><div><br /></div>Hirschman's intellectual contributions were varied and many but the jewel in the crown is his masterpiece&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/04/astonishing-voice-of-albert-hirschman.html\">Exit, Voice and Loyalty</a>. In this one slim volume, he managed to overturn conventional wisdom on one issue after another, and chart several new directions for research.&nbsp;The book is concerned with the mechanisms that can arrest and reverse declines in the performance of firms, organizations, and states. It was the interplay of two such mechanisms - desertion and articulation, or exit and voice - which Hirschman considered to be of central importance.<br /><br />Exit, for instance through the departure of customers or employees or citizens in favor of a rival, can alert an organization to its own decline and set in motion corrective measures. But so can voice, or the articulation of discontent. Too rapid a rate of exit can undermine voice and result in organizational collapse instead of recovery. But a complete inability to exit can make voice futile, and poor performance can continue indefinitely.<br /><br />Poorly functioning organizations prefer that an exit option be available to their most strident critics, so that they are left with less demanding customers or members or citizens. Hence a moderate amount of exit can result in the worst of all worlds, \"an oppression of the weak by the incompetent and an exploitation of the poor by the lazy which is the more durable and stifling as it is both <i>unambitious</i> and <i>escapable</i>.\" Near-monopolies with exit options for the most severely discontented can therefore function more poorly than complete monopolies. It is not surprising that many dysfunctional states welcome the voluntary exile of their fiercest internal critics.<br /><br />The propensity to exit is itself determined by the extent of loyalty to a firm or state. Loyalty slows down the rate of exit and can allow an organization time to recover from lapses in performance. But blind loyalty, which stifles voice even as it prevents exit, can allow poor performance to persist. It is in the interest of organizations to promote loyalty and raise the \"price of exit\", but the short term gains from doing so can lead to eventual collapse as both mechanisms for recuperation are weakened.<br /><br />Among Hirschman's many targets were the Downsian model of political competition and the Median Voter Theorem. Since he considered collective action to be an expression of voice, readily adopted in response to dissatisfaction, there was no such thing as a \"captive voter.\" Those on the fringes of a political party could not be taken for granted simply because they had no exit option: the inability to exit &nbsp;just strengthened their inclination to exercise voice. This they would do with relish, driving parties away from the median voter, as political leaders trade-off the fear of exit by moderates against the threat of voice by extremists.<br /><br />Albert Hirschman lived a long and eventful life and was a joyfully iconoclastic thinker. His books will be read by generations to come. But he will always remain something of an outsider in the profession; his ideas are just too broad and interdisciplinary to find neat expression in models and textbooks. He was an intellectual rebel throughout his life, and it is only fitting that he remain so in perpetuity.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Brogaard-Jonathan.pdf\">paper</a>&nbsp;on the profitability of high frequency traders has been attracting a fair amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/business/high-speed-trades-hurt-investors-a-study-says.html?pagewanted=all\">media</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/12/03/high-frequency-trading-arms-race-has-plenty-of-drawbacks/\">attention</a>&nbsp;lately.&nbsp;Among the authors is Andrei Kirilenko of the CFTC, whose <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1686004\">earlier study</a> of the flash crash used similar data and methods to illuminate the <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/02/market-ecology.html\">ecology</a> of trading strategies in the&nbsp;S&amp;P 500 E-mini futures market. While the earlier work examined transaction level data for four days in May 2010, the present study looks at the entire month of August 2010. Some of the new findings are startling,&nbsp;but need to be interpreted with greater care than is taken in the paper.<br /><br />High frequency traders are characterized by large volume, short holding periods, and limited overnight and intraday directional exposure:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For each day there are three categories a&nbsp;potential trader must satisfy to be considered a HFT: (1) Trade more than 10,000 contracts; (2) have an end-of-day inventory position of no more than 2% of the total contracts the firm traded that day; (3) have a maximum variation in inventory scaled by total contracts traded of less than&nbsp;15%. A firm must meet all three criteria on a given day to be considered engaging in HFT for that day. Furthermore, to be labeled an HFT firm for the purposes of this study, a firm must be&nbsp;labeled as engaging in HFT activity in at least 50% of the days it trades and must trade at least&nbsp;50% of possible trading days.&nbsp;</blockquote>Of more than 30,000 accounts in the data, only 31 fit this description. But these firms dominate the market, accounting for 47% of total trading volume and appearing on one or both sides&nbsp;of almost 75% of traded contracts. And they do this with minimal directional exposure: average intraday inventory amounts to just 2% of trading volume, and the overnight inventory of the median HFT firm is precisely zero.<br /><br />This small set of firms is then further subdivided into categories based on the extent to which they are providers of liquidity. For any given trade, the liquidity taker is the&nbsp;firm that initiates the transaction, by submitting an order that is marketable against one that is resting in the order book. The counterparty to the trade (who previously submitted the resting limit order) is the liquidity provider. Based on this criterion, the authors partition the set of high frequency traders into three subcategories: aggressive, mixed, and passive:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To be considered an Aggressive HFT, a firm must... initiate at least 40% of the trades it enters into, and must do so for at least 50% of the trading days in which it is active. To be considered a Passive HFT a firm must initiate fewer than 20% of the trades it enters into, and must do so for at least&nbsp;50% of the trading days during which it is active. Those HFTs that meet neither... definition are labeled as Mixed HFTs. There are 10 Aggressive, 11 Mixed, and 10&nbsp;Passive HFTs.</blockquote><div>This heterogeneity among high frequency traders conflicts with the common claim that such firms are generally net providers of liquidity. In fact, the authors find that \"some HFTs are almost&nbsp;100% liquidity takers, and these firms trade the most and are the most profitable.\"<br /><br />Given the richness of their data, the authors are able to compute profitability, risk-exposure, and measures of risk-adjusted performance for all firms. Gross profits are significant on average but show considerable variability across firms and over time. The average HFT makes over $46,000 a day; aggressive firms make more than twice this amount. The&nbsp;standard deviation of profits is five times the mean, and the authors find that \"there are a number of trader-days in which they lose money... several HFTs even lose over a million dollars in a single day.\"<br /><br />Despite the volatility in daily profits, the risk-adjusted performance of high frequency traders is found to be spectacular:</div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">HFTs earn above-average gross rates of return for the amount of risk they take. This is true overall and for each type... Overall, the average annualized Sharpe ratio for an HFT is 9.2. Among the subcategories, Aggressive HFTs (8.46) exhibit the lowest risk-return tradeoff, while Passive HFTs do slightly better (8.56) and Mixed HFTs achieve the best performance (10.46)... The distribution is wide, with an inter-quartile range of 2.23 to 13.89 for all HFTs. Nonetheless, even the low end of HFT risk-adjusted performance is seven times higher than the Sharpe ratio of the S&amp;P 500 (0.31).</blockquote><div>These are interesting findings, but there is a serious problem with this interpretation of risk-adjusted performance.&nbsp;The authors are observing only a partial portfolio for each firm, and cannot therefore determine the firm's overall risk exposure. It is extremely likely that these firms are trading simultaneously in many markets, in which case their exposure to risk in one market may be amplified or offset by their exposures elsewhere.&nbsp;The Sharpe ratio is meaningful only when applied to a firm's entire portfolio, not to any of its individual components. For instance, it is possible to construct a low risk portfolio with a high Sharpe ratio that is composed of several high risk components, each of which has a low Sharpe ratio.<br /><br />To take an extreme example, if aggressive firms are attempting to exploit arbitrage opportunities between the futures price and the spot price of a fund that tracks the index, then the authors would have significantly overestimated the firm's risk exposure by looking only at its position in the futures market. Over short intervals, such a strategy would result in losses in one market, offset and exceeded by gains in another. Within each market the firm would appear to have significant risk exposure, even while its aggregate exposure was minimal. Over longer periods, net gains will be more evenly distributed across markets, so the profitability of the strategy can be revealed by looking at just one market. But doing so would provide a very misleading picture of the firms risk exposure, since day-to-day variations in profitability within a single market can be substantial.<br /><br />The problem is compounded by the fact that there are likely to by systematic differences across firms in the degree to which they are trading in other markets. I suspect that the most aggressive firms are in fact trading across multiple markets in a manner that lowers rather than amplifies their exposure in the market under study. Under such circumstances, the claim that aggressive firms \"exhibit the lowest risk-return tradeoff\" is without firm foundation.<br /><br />Despite these problems of interpretation, the paper is extremely valuable because it provides a framework for thinking about the aggregate costs and benefits of high frequency trading. Since contracts in this market are in zero net supply, any profits accruing to one set of traders must come at the expense of others:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">From whom do these profits come? In addition to HFTs, we divide the remaining universe of traders in the E-mini market into four categories of traders: Fundamental traders (likely institutional), Non-HFT Market Makers, Small traders (likely retail), and Opportunistic traders... HFTs earn most of their profits from Opportunistic traders, but also earn profits from Fundamental traders, Small traders, and Non-HFT Market Makers. Small traders in particular suffer the&nbsp;highest loss to HFTs on a per contract basis.</blockquote>Within the class of high frequency traders is another hierarchy: mixed firms lose to aggressive ones, and passive firms lose to both of the other types.<br /><br />The operational costs incurred by such firms include payments for&nbsp;data feeds, computer systems, co-located servers, exchange fees, and highly specialized personnel. Most of these costs do not scale up in proportion to trading volume. Since the least active firms must have positive net profitability in order to survive, the net returns of the most aggressive traders must therefore be substantial.<br /><br />In thinking about the aggregate costs and benefits of all this activity, it's worth bringing to mind <a href=\"http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/WSJ_2-07.pdf\">Bogle's&nbsp;law</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It is the iron law of the markets, the undefiable rules of arithmetic: Gross&nbsp;return in the market, less the costs of financial intermediation, equals the net return&nbsp;actually delivered to market participants.</blockquote>The costs to other market participants of high frequency trading correspond roughly to the gross profitability of this small set of firms. What about the benefits? The two most commonly cited are price discovery and liquidity provision. It appears that the net effect on liquidity of the most aggressive traders is negative even under routine market conditions.&nbsp;Furthermore, even normally passive firms can become liquidity takers under&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/10/rt-leuchtkafer-on-flash-crash-report.html\">stressed conditions</a>&nbsp;when liquidity is most needed but in vanishing supply.<br /><br />As far as price discovery is concerned, high frequency trading&nbsp;is based on a strategy of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/blame-instructions-not-machines.html\">information extraction</a>&nbsp;from market data. This can speed up the response to changes in fundamental information, and maintain price consistency across related assets. But the heavy lifting as far as price discovery is concerned is done by those who feed information to the market about the earnings potential of publicly traded companies. This kind of research cannot (yet) be done algorithmically.<br /><br />A great deal of trading activity in financial markets is privately profitable but wasteful in the aggregate, since it involves a shuffling of net returns with no discernible effect on production or economic growth. Jack Hirschleifer made this <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1811850\">point</a>&nbsp;way back in 1971, when the financial sector was a fraction of its current size. James Tobin <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/james-tobins-hirsch-lecture.html\">reiterated</a> these concerns a decade or so later.&nbsp;David Glasner, who was fortunate enough to have studied with Hirshlefier, has recently described our predicament <a href=\"http://uneasymoney.com/2012/03/28/soak-the-rich/\">thus</a>:</div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our current overblown financial sector is largely built on people hunting, scrounging, doing whatever they possibly can, to obtain any scrap of useful information — useful, that is for anticipating a price movement that can be traded on. But the net value to society from all the resources expended on that feverish, obsessive, compulsive, all-consuming search for information is close to zero (not exactly zero, but close to zero), because the gains from obtaining slightly better information are mainly obtained at some other trader’s expense. There is a net gain to society from faster adjustment of prices to their equilibrium levels, and there is a gain from the increased market liquidity resulting from increased trading generated by the acquisition of new information. But those gains are second-order compared to gains that merely reflect someone else’s losses. That’s why there is clearly overinvestment — perhaps massive overinvestment — in the mad quest for information.</blockquote>To this I would add the following: too great a proliferation of information extracting strategies is not only wasteful in the aggregate, it can also result in <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/algorithmic-trading-and-price.html\">market instability</a>. Any change in incentives that substantially lengthens holding periods and shifts the composition of trading strategies towards those that transmit rather than extract information could therefore be both stabilizing and growth enhancing.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">A couple of days ago Intrade <a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/news/id/782\">announced</a> that it was closing its doors to US residents in response to \"legal and regulatory pressures.\" American traders are required to close out their positions by December 23rd, and withdraw all remaining funds by the 31st. Liquidity has dried up and spreads have widened&nbsp;considerably since the announcement. There have even been sharp price movements in some markets with no significant news, reflecting a skewed geographic distribution of beliefs regarding the likelihood of certain events.<br /><br />The company will survive, maybe even thrive, as it adds new contracts on sporting events to cater to it's customers in Europe and elsewhere. But the contracts that made it famous - the US election markets - will dwindle and perhaps even disappear. Even a cursory glance at the Intrade forum reveals the importance of its US customers to these markets. Individuals from all corners of the country with views spanning the ideological spectrum, and detailed knowledge of their own political subcultures, will no longer be able to participate. There will be a rebirth at some point, perhaps launched by a new entrant with regulatory approval, but for the moment there is a vacuum in a once vibrant corner of the political landscape.<br /><br />The closure was precipitated by a CFTC <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6423-12\">suit</a> alleging that the company \"solicited and permitted\" US persons to buy and sell commodity options without being a registered exchange, in violation of US law. But it <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/are-prediction-markets-against-the-public-interest.html\">appears</a> that hostility to prediction markets among regulators runs deeper than that, since an attempt by Nadex to register and offer binary options contracts on political events was previously&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6224-12\">denied</a>&nbsp;on the grounds that \"the contracts involve gaming and are contrary to the public interest.\"<br /><br />The CFTC did not specify why exactly such markets are contrary to the public interest, and it's worth <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennockd/status/273263505992474624\">asking</a> what the basis for such a position might be.<br /><br />I can think of two reasons, neither of which are particularly compelling in this context. First, all traders have to post margin equal to their worst-case loss, even though in the aggregate the payouts from all bets will net to zero. This means that cash is tied up as collateral to support speculative bets, when it could be put to more productive uses such as the financing of investment. This is a <a href=\"http://www.voxeu.org/article/economic-consequences-speculative-side-bets-case-naked-cds\">capital diversion</a> effect.&nbsp;Second, even though the exchange&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/aav2/safeFunds.html\">claims</a>&nbsp;to keep this margin in segregated accounts, separate from company funds, there is always the possibility that its deposits are not fully insured and could be lost if the Irish banking system were to collapse. These losses would ultimately be incurred by traders, who would then have very limited legal recourse.<br /><br />These arguments are not without merit. But if one really wanted to restrain the diversion of capital to support speculative positions, Intrade is hardly the place to start. Vastly greater amounts of collateral are tied up in support of speculation using interest rate and currency swaps, credit derivatives, options, and futures contracts. It is true that such contracts can also be used to reduce risk exposures, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/11/27/the-folly-of-making-political-prediction-markets-like-intrade-illegal/\">so can</a>&nbsp;prediction markets. Furthermore,&nbsp;the volume of derivatives trading has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://moneymorning.com/2008/04/02/credit-default-swaps-a-50-trillion-problem/\">far exceeded</a>&nbsp;levels needed to accommodate hedging demands for at least a decade.&nbsp;Sheila Bair recently&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/10/of-bulls-and-bair.html\">described</a>&nbsp;synthetic CDOs and naked CDSs as \"a game of fantasy football\" with unbounded stakes. In comparison with the scale of betting in licensed exchanges and over-the-counter swaps, Intrade's capital diversion effect is truly negligible.<br /><br />The second argument, concerning the segregation and safety of funds, is more relevant. Even if the exchange maintains a strict separation of company funds from posted margin despite the absence of regulatory oversight, there's always the possibility that its <a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/aav2/safeFunds.html\">deposits</a> in the Irish banking system are not fully secure. Sophisticated traders are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bb.intrade.com/intradeForum/posts/list/492830.page\">well aware</a>&nbsp;of this risk, which could be&nbsp;substantially mitigated (though clearly <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/03/us-mfglobal-funds-idUSTRE7B203J20111203\">not eliminated</a>&nbsp;entirely) by licensing and regulation.<br /><br />In judging the wisdom of the CFTC action, it's also worth considering the <a href=\"http://hanson.gmu.edu/promisepredmkt.pdf\">benefits</a> that prediction markets provide. Attempts at <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">manipulation</a> notwithstanding, it's hard to imagine a major election in the US without the prognostications of pundits and pollsters being measured against the markets. They have become part of the fabric of social interaction and conversation around political events.<br /><br />But from my perspective, the primary benefit of prediction markets has been pedagogical.&nbsp;I've used them frequently in my financial economics course to illustrate basic concepts such as expected return, risk, skewness, margin, short sales, trading algorithms, and arbitrage. Intrade has been generous with its data, allowing public access to order books, charts and spreadsheets, and this information has found its way over the years into slides, problem sets, and exams.&nbsp;All of this could have been done using other sources and methods, but the canonical prediction market contract - a binary option on a visible and familiar public event - is particularly well suited for these purposes.<br /><br />The first time I <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2003/08/in-extraordinary-sequence-of-events.html\">wrote</a> about prediction markets on this blog was back in August 2003. Intrade didn't exist at the time but its precursor, Tradesports, was up and running, and the Iowa Electronic Markets had already been active for over a decade. Over the nine years since that early post, I've used data from prediction markets to discuss&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2006/10/price-inconsistencies.html\">arbitrage</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/07/market-overreaction-case-study.html\">overreaction</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">manipulation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/on-prediction-markets-for-climate.html\">self-fulfilling prophecies</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/10/algorithms-arbitrage-and-overreaction.html\">algorithmic trading</a>, and&nbsp;the interpretation of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/03/on-interpretation-of-prediction-market.html\">prices</a> and <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/03/from-order-books-to-belief.html\">order books</a>. Many of these posts have been about broader issues that also arise in more economically significant markets, but can be seen with great clarity in the Intrade laboratory.<br /><br />It seems to me that the energies of regulators would be better directed elsewhere, at real and significant threats to financial stability, instead of being targeted at a small scale exchange which has become culturally significant and serves an educational purpose. The CFTC action just reinforces the perception that financial sector enforcement in the United States is a random, arbitrary process and that regulators keep on missing the wood for the trees.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br />Update: NPR's Yuki Noguchi <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/11/29/166177281/y\">follows up</a> with Justin Wolfers, Thomas Bell, Laurence Lau, and Jason Ruspini here; definitely worth a listen.

Perhaps too frankly: it was quickly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/an-anti-ip-turn-for-the-gop/\">disavowed</a> and taken down on the grounds that publication had occurred \"without adequate review.\" Copies continue to circulate, of course (the link above is to one I posted on Scribd). Although lightly peppered with ideological boilerplate, the brief makes a number of timely and sensible points and is worth reading in full.<br /><br />Aside from extolling the virtues of \"a robust culture of DJ’s and remixing\" free from the stranglehold of copyright protection, the authors of the report make the following claims.&nbsp;First, the&nbsp;purpose of copyright law, according to the constitution, is to \"promote the progress of science and useful arts\" and not to \"compensate the creator of the content.\" Copyright law should therefore be evaluated by the degree to which it facilitates innovation and creative expression. Second, unlike conventional tort law, statutory damages for infringement are \"vastly disproportionate from the actual damage to the copyright producer.\" For instance, Limewire was sued for $75 trillion, \"more money than the entire music recording industry has made since&nbsp;Edison’s invention of the phonograph in 1877.\"&nbsp;Third, the duration of coverage has been expanding, seemingly without limit. In 1790 a 14 year term could be renewed once if the the author remained alive; current coverage is for the life of the author plus 70 years.&nbsp;This stifles rather than promotes creative activity.<br /><br />The economists Michele Boldrin and David Levine have been making these points for years. In their book <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=vdBtQgAACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">Against Intellectual Monopoly</a> (reviewed <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-intellectual-property-and-guard.html\">here</a>), they point out that the pace of innovation in industries without patent and copyright protection has historically been extremely rapid. Software could not be patented before 1981, nor financial securities prior to 1998, yet both industries witnessed innovation at a blistering pace. The fashion industry remains largely untouched by intellectual property law, yet new designs keep appearing and enriching their creators. Innovative techniques in professional sports continue to be developed, despite the fact that successful ones are quickly copied and disseminated.<br /><br />In 19th century publishing, British authors had limited protection in the United States but managed to secure lucrative deals with publishers, allowing the latter to saturate the market at low prices before new entrants could gain a foothold. More recently, commercial publishers have turned a profit selling millions of copies of unprotected government documents. For instance, the 9/11 Commission Report was published by both <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OCDdPk1ssC\">Norton</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=r6agY6DUEJsC\">Macmillan</a> in 2004, and a third version by <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=TjKODEaahVQC\">Cosimo</a> is now available.<br /><br />Copyright restrictions for scientific papers are especially illogical, since faculty authors benefit from the widest possible dissemination and citation of their work. Furthermore, in the case of journals owned by commercial publishers, copyright is typically transferred by the author to the publisher.&nbsp;Neither the content creators nor the uncompensated peer-reviewers who evaluate manuscripts for publication benefit from protection in such cases. Fortunately, thanks to the emergence of new high-quality open-source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.econtheory.org/\">journals</a> sponsored by academic societies, things are starting to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/03/future-of-academic-publishing.html\">change</a>.<br /><br />It's not clear why the policy brief was taken down, or what motivated it in the first place. Henry Farrell, while agreeing with the positions taken in the report, <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/11/17/radicals-for-capitalism/\">argues</a> that damage to an industry that has historically supported Democrats may be a factor. In contrast,&nbsp;Jordan Bloom and Alex Tabarrok <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-astonishing-cravenness-of-the-rsc/\">both</a> <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/dont-mess-with-the-mouse.html\">believe</a> that pressure on Republicans from the entertainment industry led to the brief being withdrawn.&nbsp;They can't all be right as far as I can see. But less interesting than the motivation for the report is its content, and the long overdue debate on patents and copyrights that could finally be stirred in its wake.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Prediction Market Manipulation: A Case Study") (content ((type . "html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The experience of watching election returns come in has become vastly more social and interactive than it was just a decade ago. Television broadcasts still provide the core pubic information around which expectations are formed, but blogs and twitter feeds are sources of customized private information that can have significant effects on the evolution of beliefs. And prediction markets aggregate this private information and channel it back into the public sphere.<br /><br />All of this activity has an impact not only on our beliefs and moods, but also on our behavior. In particular, beliefs that one's candidate of choice has lost can affect turnout. It has been argued, for instance, that early projections of victory for Reagan in 1980 depressed Democratic turnout in California, and that Republican turnout in Florida was similarly affected in 2000 when the state was called for Gore while voting in the panhandle was still underway. For this reason, early exit poll data is kept tightly under wraps these days, and states are called for one candidate or another only after polls have closed.<br /><br />This effect of beliefs on behavior implies that a candidate facing long odds of victory has an incentive to inflate these odds and project confidence in public statements, lest the demoralizing effects of pessimism cause the likelihood of victory to decline even further. Traditionally this would be done by partisans on television sketching out implausible scenarios and interpretations of the incoming data to boost their supporters. But with the increasing visibility of prediction markets, this strategy is much less effective. If a collapse in the price of a contract on Intrade reveals that a candidate is doing much worse than expected, no amount of cheap talk on television can do much to change the narrative.<br /><br />Given this, the incentives to interfere with what the markets are saying becomes quite powerful. Even though trading volume has risen dramatically in prediction markets over recent years, the amount of money required to have a sustained price impact for a few hours remains quite small, especially in comparison with the vast sums now spent on advertising.<br /><br />In general, I believe that observers are too quick to allege manipulation when they see unusual price movements in such markets. As I noted in an <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/10/algorithms-arbitrage-and-overreaction.html\">earlier post</a>, a spike in the price of the Romney contract a few days ago was probably driven by naive traders over-reacting to rumors of a game-changing announcement by Donald Trump, rather than by any systematic attempt at price manipulation. My reasons for thinking so were based on the fact that frenzied purchases of a single contract (while ignoring complementary contracts) are terribly ineffective if the goal is to have a sustained impact on prices. If one really wants to manipulate a market, it has to be done by placing large orders that serve as price ceilings and floors, and to do this across complementary contracts in a consistent way.<br /><br />As it happens, this is exactly what someone tried to do yesterday. At around 3:30 pm, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">noticed</a> that the order book for both Obama and Romney contracts on Intrade had become unusually asymmetric, with a large block of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">buy orders</a> for Romney in the 28-30 range, and a corresponding block of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265917575261720576\">sell orders</a> for Obama in the 70-72 range. Here's the Romney order book:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X-EVZpNeNpI/UJrKzsWsfUI/AAAAAAAAB5A/TKROHnRcpQU/s1600/RomneyBook.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X-EVZpNeNpI/UJrKzsWsfUI/AAAAAAAAB5A/TKROHnRcpQU/s320/RomneyBook.png\" width=\"180\" /></a></div>And here's the book for Obama:  <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CwSn748ZHIA/UJrK45wS0eI/AAAAAAAAB5I/uecwiTAI9-M/s1600/ObamaBook.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CwSn748ZHIA/UJrK45wS0eI/AAAAAAAAB5I/uecwiTAI9-M/s320/ObamaBook.png\" width=\"182\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br />Since the exchange requires traders to post 100% margin (to cover their worst case loss and eliminate counterparty risk), the funds required to place these orders was about $240,000 in total. A non-trivial amount, but probably less than the cost of a thirty-second commercial during primetime.<br /><br />Could this not have been just a big bet, placed by someone optimistic about Romney's chances? I don't think so, for two reasons. First, if one wanted to bet on Romney rather than Obama, much better odds were available elsewhere, for instance on Betfair. More importantly, one would not want to leave such large orders standing at a time when new information was emerging rapidly; the risk of having the orders met by someone with superior information would be too great. Yet these orders stood for hours, and effectively placed a floor on the Romney price and a ceiling on the price for Obama.<br /><br />Meanwhile odds in other markets were shifting rapidly. Nate Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/live-blog-the-2012-presidential-election/?src=twt&amp;twt=fivethirtyeight#differences-in-political-betting-markets-persist\">noticed</a> the widening disparity and was puzzled by it, arguing that differences across markets should \"evaporate on Election Day itself, when the voting is over and there is little seeming benefit from affecting the news media coverage.\" Much as I <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/12/is-nate-sliver-worlds-22nd-best.html\">admire</a> Nate, I think that he was mistaken here. It is precisely on election day that market manipulation makes most sense, since one only needs to affect media coverage for a few hours until all relevant polls have closed. Voting was still ongoing in Colorado, and keeping Romney viable there was the only hope of stitching together a victory. Florida, Virginia and Ohio were all close at the time and none had been called for Obama. A loss in Colorado would have made these three states irrelevant and a Romney victory virtually impossible.<br /><br />Given this interpretation, I felt that the floor would collapse once the Colorado polls closed at 9pm Eastern Time, and this is precisely what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/266004367281360896\">happened</a>:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bVdLFOBeRm4/UJpptzZxc8I/AAAAAAAAB4w/Nnz9I41afCY/s1600/FloorRomney.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"126\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bVdLFOBeRm4/UJpptzZxc8I/AAAAAAAAB4w/Nnz9I41afCY/s400/FloorRomney.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Once the floor gave way, the price fell to single digits in a matter of minutes and never recovered. <br /><br />It turned out, of course, that none of this was to matter: Virginia, Ohio, and (probably) Florida have all fallen to Obama. But all were close, and the possibility of a different outcome could not have been ruled out at the time. The odds were low, and a realistic projection of these odds would have made them even lower. Such is the <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/01/on-prediction-markets-and-self.html\">positive feedback</a> loop between beliefs and outcomes in politics. Under the circumstances, the loss of a few hundred thousand dollars to keep alive the prospect of a Romney victory probably seemed like a good investment to someone.<br /><br />Should one be concerned about such attempts at manipulation? I don't think so. They muddy the waters a bit but are transparent enough to be spotted quickly and reacted to. My initial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">post</a>&nbsp;was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinwolfers/status/265923012610650112\">retweeted</a>&nbsp;within minutes&nbsp;by Justin Wolfers to 24,000 followers, and by Chris Hayes to 160,000 shortly thereafter. Attempts at manipulating beliefs are nothing new in presidential politics, it's just the methods that have changed. And as long as one is aware of the possibility of such manipulation, it is relatively easy to spot and counter. The same social media that transmits misinformation also allows for the broadcast of countervailing narratives. In the end the fog clears and reality asserts itself. Or so one hopes.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---&nbsp;</div><br /><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Update: The following chart shows the Obama price breaking through the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265998523181453312/photo/1\">ceiling</a> just before the polls closed in Colorado:  </div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JmLhnU62TnA/UJvObayTW1I/AAAAAAAAB5Y/gEc79BSqCZ0/s1600/ObamaCeiling.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"126\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JmLhnU62TnA/UJvObayTW1I/AAAAAAAAB5Y/gEc79BSqCZ0/s400/ObamaCeiling.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />It's the extraordinary stability of the price before 8:45pm, which was sustained over several hours, that is suggestive of manipulation.<br /><br />") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every election year, like clockwork, some people feel the need to remind the rest of us that (contrary to the exhortations of politicians and peers) our votes do not, in fact, count. Not only do they not count in New York, California or Texas, they don't count in Colorado, Ohio, or Florida either. While the likelihood that a single vote will be decisive may be incrementally higher in the latter set of states, it is negligible everywhere. Steve Levitt goes so far as to <a href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/25/we-the-sheeple-full-transcript/\">say</a> that \"it’s only the not so smart people who vote because they’re actually going to influence the election.\" Phil Arena is a bit more charitable, <a href=\"http://fparena.blogspot.com/2012/11/some-thoughts-on-voting.html\">arguing</a> that \"people who believe that their vote counts are simply mistaken.\" Kindred Winecoff <a href=\"http://ipeatunc.blogspot.com/2012/11/on-voting.html\">concurs</a>.<br /><br />Here's Arena's <a href=\"http://fparena.blogspot.com/2012/11/some-thoughts-on-voting.html\">version</a> of the argument:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">If you've ever said something like \"My vote doesn't count, because I live in New York\", you're the type of person who makes my head hurt. &nbsp;We may not know for sure how things will turn out in New Hampshire this coming Tuesday, but that doesn't mean that an individual's vote will \"count\" for much of anything in that state. &nbsp; The fact that everyone who knows anything about politics knows how things will go in New York (or California, or Texas) doesn't make any meaningful difference to the question of whether individual votes in those states are likely to determine the outcome... &nbsp;Don't confuse uncertainty over the final outcome with a significant probability of a single vote determining the outcome. &nbsp;Those two things are not even remotely the same.</blockquote>And yet we have people <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/11/huge_turnout_long_lines_for_ea.html\">waiting in line</a> for hours to cast ballots in Ohio, and making <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/11/04/v-fullstory/3081614/florida-democratic-party-files.html\">multiple trips</a> to polling stations in Florida, bearing significant burdens to engage in what Winecoff <a href=\"http://ipeatunc.blogspot.com/2012/11/on-voting.html\">asserts</a> is simply \"cheap talk.\" Would these voters make similar sacrifices to vote in New York or California? And if not, are they somehow deluded or dumb?<br /><br />I believe that it is Arena and Levitt who are mistaken about the rationality of voting, and not the voters themselves. The premise of their argument is correct, but not the conclusions they draw from it. The&nbsp;likelihood of a single vote being decisive is negligible in all states, and voters by and large are fully cognizant of this fact. And yet it is perfectly rational for some voters to incur significant costs to vote in New York, and to incur even greater costs to do so in Ohio.<br /><br />To see why, one needs only to recognize that the elation one feels when a preferred candidate wins depends both on the margin of victory and on whether or not one has cast a ballot. A single voter cannot materially affect the former, but can certainly determine the latter. Furthermore, the margin of victory can be forecast with a fair amount of accuracy: there is little doubt that the margin in Ohio, no matter who wins tomorrow, will be smaller than that in New York. Provided that the joy of celebrating a victory is greater when one has cast a ballot, and especially so when the margin of victory is small, it makes perfect sense to incur greater costs to vote in Ohio than in New York.<br /><br />Similar arguments apply to the grief that comes with defeat. In this case it is the failure to cast a ballot when the margin is tight that can give rise to great regret. People in this situation are perfectly well aware that their vote alone would not have materially affected the outcome, but they are not much comforted by this thought.&nbsp;The point is that if a relatively small coalition could have jointly generated a different outcome, then one's failure to join such a coalition can be a cause of distress. There is nothing irrational about such preferences, and they clearly lead to greater turnout when and where elections are predicted to be close. This turnout differential is not based on mistaken beliefs about what one alone can accomplish, and is not driven by cognitive limitations either.<br /><br />This perspective on voting also explains why people often vote strategically, rather than always voting their conscience. Think of Nader supporters contemplating a vote for Gore in 2000. The size of the coalition of such supporters who could have blocked a Bush victory in Florida turned out to be extremely small, and the possibility that Nader could play such a spoiler role in the election was certainly anticipated. Some of those who chose to vote their conscience may well have regretted this choice once the outcome of the election was finally determined, and some who chose to vote for Gore may well have done so to avoid such regret. The fact that no single voter was decisive is entirely irrelevant. Collective responsibility for coalitional choices comes naturally to us, especially when the groups involved are not large. It is not the motives themselves, but the pretense that they do not exist that constitutes the true departure from rationality.<br /><br />People vote for all kinds of different reasons. Some consider it a civic duty, others enjoy the process, and still others take satisfaction from the exercise of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/04/astonishing-voice-of-albert-hirschman.html\">voice</a>. Voting can be a powerful <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=60CoGvHcJQIC\">expression</a> of identity; an affirmation, as Noah Millman <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/millman/should-i-be-voting-third-party/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=should-i-be-voting-third-party\">puts it</a>, of membership in a political tribe. It can be a result of peer pressure or the desire to avoid social sanction. But&nbsp;incurring greater costs to vote in closer elections is also perfectly consistent&nbsp;with a calm, reasoned, and above all <i>intelligent</i> response to the preferences with which we are endowed.</div><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br /><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Update: <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/25/steven-levitt-says-that-he-has-a-good-indicator-that-aaron-edlin-noah-kaplan-nate-silver-and-i-are-not-so-smart/\">Andrew Gelman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3570.html\">Steve Waldman</a> are also worth reading on these issues, although their perspectives differ somewhat from mine. Andrew argues that in swing states the probabilities of being decisive are not effectively negligible, and therefore does not accept the basic premise of Arena's argument. Steve maintains that the argument is \"right but wrong-headed\" and shows that norms of political participation sustained by sanctions can be stable. Voting is clearly rational in the presence of such norms, as is resistance to the kinds of arguments that Arena makes.<br /><br />The first action I took as an American citizen was to register to vote; I did this within minutes of receiving my naturalization certificate.

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">There were some startling price movements in the presidential contracts on Intrade yesterday. Here's the price and volume chart for the Romney contract, which pays out $10 if he is elected and nothing otherwise:<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZjqhqKvBnmQ/UIe4O3eN08I/AAAAAAAAB3g/K0KgNm1T_fo/s1600/Romney.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"125\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZjqhqKvBnmQ/UIe4O3eN08I/AAAAAAAAB3g/K0KgNm1T_fo/s400/Romney.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />At 7:52am the price of this contract stood at 40 (this is a percentage of the contract face value, so represents $4.00). Over the next two hours the price edged up to 42, with about 4500 contracts traded. That's where things stood at 9:58. Over the next three minutes the price rose sharply to 48.5, with a further 1700 contracts traded. This was followed by sharp oscillating movements between the peak and 42, which can be seen as the red blur at around 10am in the chart. By 10:15 the price had fallen to 43 and the oscillations had mostly ceased. An hour later the price was back down to 41, with about 14,000 contracts and $63,000 having changed hands over three hours.<br /><br />What caused this unusual price behavior?&nbsp;There's been some talk of attempted price <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/10/should-presidential-campaigns-spend-more-money-manipulating-intrade/264000/\">manipulation</a>, but I have my doubts because the trader who was buying aggressively over this period was extremely naive. (I am fairly certain that this was a single trader). Throughout the buying frenzy, the Obama contract never fell below 57 and there was a substantial block of bids at or above this price. The trader who was buying Romney at 48 could have made the same bet for 43 by simply selling the Obama contract at 57. In fact, he would have obtained a slightly superior contract, which would pay off if any person other than Obama were to win, including but not limited to Romney.<br /><br />This fact also explains the oscillations in the Romney price, and the decline to 57 under selling pressure of the Obama price. Any individual who had posted ask prices in the 43-48 range in the Romney market had these orders met by the crazed buyer, and could then sell Obama above 57 for an immediate arbitrage profit. As it happens, there are algorithms active on Intrade that do precisely this. They post ask prices that, together with with highest bid in the complementary contract, add up to slightly more than 100. As soon as these orders trade, they sell the complementary contract at once, booking a riskless profit. These algorithms posted prices in the 42-43 range over the period in question, and the buyer repeatedly traded through them to reach the higher Romney asks. Hence the red blur in the chart. Only when the buyer gave up or ran out of funds did the price settle down.<br /><br />If this was not an instance of attempted manipulation, then what was it? I suspect that it was an overzealous response to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/49515813\">reports</a> of a major announcement concerning the presidential race, promised by Donald Trump. Further <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/260938908622286848\">frenzied activity</a> in the presidential and state level markets took place in the evening, as <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/10/23/is_this_trumps_bombshell.html\">speculation</a> about the nature of the announcement started to spread. <br /><br />This whole bizarre episode tells us very little about the presidential race, but does shed some light on how these markets work. Changes in one market spill over instantaneously to changes in linked markets via arbitrage, some of it executed algorithmically. And algorithms that work very effectively when rare can end up with disastrous results if copied. For instance, if two algorithms were to follow the strategy outlined above, it is possible that only one of them may be able to complete the second sale since the first mover would have snapped up the existing bids. This kind of game is currently being played in the world of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/business/with-profits-dropping-high-speed-trading-cools-down.html\">high frequency trading</a>, but with much higher stakes and considerably more serious economic consequences. &nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Of Bulls and Bair") (content ((type . "html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sheila Bair's new book,&nbsp;<i>Bull by the Horns</i>, is both a crisis narrative and a thoughtful reflection on economic institutions and policy. The crisis narrative, with its&nbsp;revealing first-hand accounts of&nbsp;high-level meetings, high-stakes negotiations, behind-the-scenes jockeying, and clashing personalities will attract the most immediate attention. But it's the economic analysis that&nbsp;will constitute the more enduring contribution.<br /><br />Among the many highlights are the following: a discussion of the linkages between securitization, credit derivatives and loan modifications, an exploration of the trade-off between regulatory capture and regulatory arbitrage, an intriguing question about the optimal timing of auctions for failing banks, a proposal for ending too big to fail that relies on simplification and asset segregation rather than balance sheet contraction, a full-throated defense of sensible financial regulation, and a passionate critique of bailouts for the powerful and politically connected even when such transactions appear to generate an accounting profit. <br /><br />Let's start with securitization, derivatives and loan modifications.&nbsp;Under the traditional model of mortgage lending, there are strong incentives for creditors to modify delinquent loans if the costs of doing so are lower than the very substantial deadweight losses that result from foreclosure. But pooling and tranching of mortgage loans creates a conflict of interest <i>within</i> the group of investors. As long as foreclosures are not widespread enough to affect holders of the overcollateralized senior tranches, all losses are inflicted upon those with junior claims. In contrast, loan modifications&nbsp;lower payments to all tranches, and will thus be resisted by holders of senior claims unless they truly see disaster looming. One consequence of this \"tranche warfare\" is that servicers, fearing lawsuits, will be inclined to favor foreclosure over modification.<br /><br />But this is not the end of the story. Bair points out that&nbsp;the interests of those using credit derivatives to bet on declines in home values are aligned with those of holders of senior tranches, as long as the latter continue to believe that foreclosures will not become widespread enough to eat into their protected positions. This is interesting because these two groups are taking quite different price views: one is long and the other short credit risk. Bair notes that some of the \"early resistance\" to FDIC loan modification initiatives came from fund managers who \"had purchased CDS protection against losses on mortgage-backed securities they did not own.\" The irony is that they were joined in this resistance by holders of senior tranches who were relying (overoptimistically, as it turned out) on&nbsp;the protective buffer provided by the holders of junior claims.<br /><br />Another interesting discussion in the book concerns the trade-off between regulatory arbitrage and regulatory capture.&nbsp;A fragmented regulatory structure with a variety of norms and standards encourages financial institutions to shop for the weakest regulator. In the lead up to the crisis, such regulatory shopping occurred between banks and nonbanks, with mortgage brokers and securities firms operating outside the stronger regulations imposed on insured banks. But Bair also notes that&nbsp;the \"three biggest problem institutions among insured banks - Citigroup, Wachovia, and WaMu - had not shopped for charters; they had been with the same regulator for decades. The problem was that their regulators did not have independence from them.\"<br /><br />This is the problem of regulatory capture. Bair argues that while a single monolithic regulator would put an end to regulatory arbitrage, it could worsen the problem of regulatory capture:&nbsp;\"a diversity of views and the ability of one agency to look over the shoulder of another is a good check against regulators becoming too close to the entities they regulate.\"&nbsp;It's a point that she has made&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/opinion/01bair.html\">before</a>, and clearly believes (with considerable justification) that the FDIC has provided such checks and balances in the past. It was able to do so in part through its power under the law and in part through the power to persuade; yet another reminder of the continued relevance of Albert Hirschman's notion of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/04/astonishing-voice-of-albert-hirschman.html\">voice</a>.<br /><br />A very different kind of trade-off concerns the timing of auctions for failing banks. One of the policies that Bair favored at the FDIC was the quick sale of failing banks prior to closure in order to avoid a period of government stewardship. She recognizes, however, that there are some costs to this. Bids from prospective buyers who have not had time to closely examine the asset pool of the failing institution will tend to be lower than the expected value of these assets, given the need to maintain adequate margins of safety in the face of risk. Waiting until a more precise estimate of the value of the bank's assets can be obtained can therefore result in higher bids on average. But there are also costs to waiting: a \"deterioration of franchise value\" occurs as large depositors and business customers look elsewhere, and this can offset any gains from a more precise valuation of the asset pool. Bair seems to have concluded that sale before closure was always the best course of action, but I suspect that this need not be the case, especially when the asset pool is characterized by high expected value but great uncertainty, and the bulk of deposits are insured. In any case, it's a question deserving of systematic study.<br /><br />Bair describes herself as a lifelong Republican and McCain voter; she is contemplating a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/former-regulator-sheila-bair-financial-crisis\">write-in</a>&nbsp;vote for Jon Huntsman this November. Yet she seems quite immune to partisan loyalties and pressures.&nbsp;Her description of Barney Frank is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/253009493049360384\">positively affectionate</a>.&nbsp;She has kind words for some Democrats (such as Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner), but offers blistering criticism of others (Robert Rubin, Tim Geithner and Larry Summers in particular). Among Republicans too, she is discerning: Bob Corker's efforts on financial reform are lauded, but the \"deregulatory dogma\" overseen by Alan Greenspan comes under forceful attack. She laments the \"disdain\" for government and its \"regulatory function\" and describes as a \"delusion\" the idea that markets are self-regulating. These are not the views of a political partisan.<br /><br />On policy, Bair is opposed to the use of derivatives for two-sided speculation (when neither party is hedging) and would require an insurable interest for the purchase of protection against default. She describes synthetic CDOs and naked CDSs as \"a game of fantasy football\" with no limit to the size of wagers that can be placed. She wants a \"lifetime ban on regulators working for financial institutions they have regulated.\" And she argues, as did James Tobin <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.in/2010/05/james-tobins-hirsch-lecture.html\">a generation ago</a>, that the attraction of the financial sector for some of the best and brightest of our youth is detrimental to long term economic growth and prosperity.<br /><br />No review of this book would be complete without mention of the bailouts, which troubled Bair from the outset, and which she now feels were excessive:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To this day, I wonder if we overreacted... Yes, action had to be taken, but the generosity of the response still troubles me... Granted, we were dealing with an emergency and had to act quickly. And the actions did stave off a broader financial crisis. But the unfairness of it and the lack of hard analysis showing the necessity of it trouble me to this day. The mere fact that a bunch of large financial institutions is going to lose money does not a systemic event make... Throughout the crisis and its aftermath, the smaller banks - which didn't benefit at all from government largesse - did a much better job of lending than the big institutions did.&nbsp;</blockquote>What bothers her most of all is the claim that the bailouts were justified because they made an accounting profit:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The thing I hate hearing most when people talk about the crisis is that the bailouts \"saved the system\" or ended up \"making money.\" Participating in bailout measures was the most distasteful thing I have ever had to do, and those ex post facto rationalizations make my skin crawl... The bailouts, while stabilizing the financial system in the short term, have created a long-term drag on our economy. Because we propped up the mismanaged institutions, our financial sector remains bloated... We did not force financial institutions to shed their bad assets and recognize their losses... Economic growth is sluggish, unemployment remains high. The housing market still struggles. I hope that our economy continues to improve. But it will do so despite the bailouts, not because of them.</blockquote>The ideal policy, according to Bair, would have been to put insolvent institutions into the \"bankruptcy-like resolution process\" used routinely by the FDIC, but she recognizes that the legal basis for doing so was not available at the time. She therefore signed on to measures that were instinctively repugnant to her, and tried to corral and contain them to the extent possible.<br /><br />The argument that the bailouts \"made money\" is specious for two reasons. First, the funds provided were given well below market value, and the cost to taxpayers should be computed relative to the value of the service provided. If insurance is provided at a fraction of the actuarially fair price, and no claim is made over the period of insurance (so the insurer makes money), this does not mean that there was no subsidy in the first place. Steve Waldman has made this point <a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2587.html\">very effectively</a>&nbsp;in the past.&nbsp;Furthermore, the cost to taxpayers should take into account any loss of revenues from more sluggish growth. If Bair is right to argue that the bailouts were excessively generous, to the point that growth prospects were damaged for an extended period, the loss of tax revenue must be included in any assessment of the cost of the bailout.<br /><br />As noted above, there are many accounts in the book of meetings and decisions, and a number of speculative inferences about the actions and intentions of others. Some of these will be <a href=\"http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2012/10/01/book_reviiew_sheila_bairs_bull_by_the_horns_99906.html\">hotly disputed</a>. But focusing on these details is to miss the larger point. The crisis offers us an opportunity to think about the flaws in our economic and political system and how some of these might be fixed. It also suggests interesting directions in which economic theorizing could be advanced. The book helps with both efforts, and it would be a pity if these substantive contributions were drowned out in a debate over conversations and&nbsp;personalities.</div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fourth anniversary of the Lehman bankruptcy has been selected as the release date for a <a href=\"http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/page15/WhatsTheUseofEconomics.html\">collection of essays</a>&nbsp;edited by Diane Coyle with the provocative title: What's the Use of Economics?&nbsp;The timing is impeccable and the question legitimate.<br /><br />The book collects together some very thoughtful responses by Andrew Haldane, John Kay, Wendy Carlin, Alan Kirman, Andrew Lo, Roger Farmer, and a host of other luminaries (the publishers were kind enough to send me an advance copy).&nbsp;There's enough material there for several posts but I'd like to start with the contribution by John Kay.<br /><br />This one, as it happens, has been <a href=\"http://www.johnkay.com/2011/10/04/the-map-is-not-the-territory-an-essay-on-the-state-of-economics\">published</a> before; I discussed Mike Woodford's reaction to it in a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/04/on-equilibrium-disequilibrium-and.html\">previous post</a>. But reading it again I realized that it contains a perspective on&nbsp;market efficiency and price discovery that is concise, penetrating and worthy of some elaboration. Kay doesn't just provide a critique of the efficient markets hypothesis; he sketches out an alternative approach based on the idea of prices as the \"product of a clash between competing narratives\" that&nbsp;can form the basis of an entire research agenda.<br /><br />He begins with a question famously posed by the Queen of England during a visit to the London School of Economics:&nbsp;Why had economists failed to predict the financial crisis? Robert Lucas&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/14165405\">pointed out</a> in response that&nbsp;the inability to predict a financial crisis was in fact a prediction of economic theory. This is as pure a distillation of the efficient markets hypothesis is one is likely to find, and Kay uses it to evaluate the hypothesis itself: <br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Lucas’s assertion that ‘no one could have predicted it’ contains an important, though partial, insight.  There can be no objective basis for a prediction of the kind ‘Lehman Bros will go into liquidation on September 15’, because if there were, people would act on that expectation and, most likely, Lehman would go into liquidation straight away.  The economic world, far more than the physical world, is influenced by our beliefs about it.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Such thinking leads, as Lucas explains, directly to the efficient market hypothesis – available knowledge is already incorporated in the price of securities.  And there is a substantial amount of truth in this – the growth prospects of Apple and Google, the problems of Greece and the Eurozone, are all reflected in the prices of shares, bonds and currencies.  The efficient market hypothesis is an illuminating idea, but it is not “Reality As It Is In Itself”.  Information is reflected in prices, but not necessarily accurately, or completely.  There are wide differences in understanding and belief, and different perceptions of a future that can be at best dimly perceived.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In his <i>Economist</i> response, Lucas acknowledges that ‘exceptions and anomalies’ to the efficient market hypothesis have been discovered, ‘but for the purposes of macroeconomic analyses and forecasts they are too small to matter’. But how could anyone know, in advance not just of this crisis but also of any future crisis, that exceptions and anomalies to the efficient market hypothesis are ‘too small to matter’? </blockquote>The literature on anomalies is not, in fact, concerned with <i>macroeconomic</i> analyses and forecasts. It is rather narrowly focused on predictability in asset prices and the possibility of constructing portfolios that can consistently beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis. And indeed, such anomalies are often found to be quite trivial, especially when one considers the costs of implementing the implied strategies. The inability of actively managed funds to beat the market on average, after accounting for costs and adjusting for risk, is often cited as providing empirical support for market efficiency. But Kay believes that these findings have not been properly interpreted:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">What Lucas means when he asserts that deviations are ‘too small to matter’ is that attempts to construct general models of deviations from the efficient market hypothesis – by specifying mechanical trading rules or by writing equations to identify bubbles in asset prices – have not met with much success. But this is to miss the point: the expert billiard player plays a nearly perfect game, but it is the imperfections of play between experts that determine the result. There is a – trivial – sense in which the deviations from efficient markets are too small to matter – and a more important sense in which these deviations are the principal thing that matters.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The claim that most profit opportunities in business or in securities markets have been taken is justified.&nbsp; But it is the search for the profit opportunities that have not been taken that drives business forward, the belief that profit opportunities that have not been arbitraged away still exist that explains why there is so much trade in securities. Far from being ‘too small to matter’, these deviations from efficient market assumptions, not necessarily large, are the dynamic of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Such anomalies are idiosyncratic and cannot, by their very nature, be derived as logical deductions from an axiomatic system. The distinguishing characteristic of Henry Ford or Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett or George Soros, is that their behaviour cannot be predicted from any prespecified model. If the behaviour of these individuals could be predicted in this way, they would not have been either innovative or rich. But the consequences are plainly not ‘too small to matter’.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The preposterous claim that deviations from market efficiency were not only irrelevant to the recent crisis but could never be relevant is the product of an environment in which deduction has driven out induction and ideology has taken over from observation. The belief that models are not just useful tools but also are capable of yielding comprehensive and universal descriptions of the world has blinded its proponents to realities that have been staring them in the face. That blindness was an element in our present crisis, and conditions our still ineffectual responses.&nbsp;</blockquote>Fair enough, but how should one proceed? Kay suggests the adoption of more&nbsp;\"eclectic analysis... not just deductive logic but also an understanding of processes of belief formation, anthropology, psychology and organisational behaviour, and meticulous observation of what people, businesses, and governments actually do.\"<br /><br />I have no quarrel with this prescription, but I'd also like to make a case for more creative and versatile deductive logic. One of the key modeling hypotheses in the economics of information is the so-called Harsanyi doctrine (or common prior assumption), which stipulates that all differences in beliefs ought to be modeled as if they arise from differences in information. This hypothesis <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591\">implies</a> that individuals can only disagree if such disagreement is not itself common knowledge: they cannot agree to disagree. It is not hard to see that such a hypothesis could not possibly allow for pure speculation on asset price movements, and hence cannot account for the large volume of trade in financial markets. In fact, it implies that order books in many markets would be empty, since a posted price would only be met by someone with superior information.<br /><br />The point is that over-reliance on deductive logic is not the only problem as far as financial modeling is concerned; the core assumptions to which deductive logic has been applied are themselves too restrictive. To my mind, the most interesting part of Kay's essay suggests how one might improve on this:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">You can learn a great deal about deviations from the efficient market hypothesis, and the role they played in the recent financial crisis, from journalistic descriptions by people like Michael Lewis and Greg Zuckerman, who describe the activities of some individuals who did predict it.  The large volume of such material that has appeared suggests many avenues of understanding that might be explored.  You could develop models in which some trading agents have incentives aligned with those of the investors who finance them and others do not.  You might describe how prices are the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world.  You might appreciate the natural human reactions that made it difficult to hold short positions when they returned losses quarter after quarter.</blockquote>There is definitely ongoing work in economics that explores many of these directions, some of which I have surveyed in <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/on-efficient-markets-and-coordination.html\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/01/john-geanakoplos-on-leverage-cycle.html\">posts</a>. But the idea of prices as&nbsp;<i>the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world</i> reminded me of a <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">paper</a> by Harrison and Kreps, which was one of the earliest models in finance to shed the common prior assumption.<br /><br />For anyone interested in developing models of heterogeneous beliefs in which trading occurs naturally over time, the Harrison-Kreps paper is the perfect place to start. They illustrate their model with an example that is easy to follow: a single asset provides title to a stream of dividend payments that may be either high or low, and investors disagree about the likelihood of transitions from high to low states and vice versa. This means that investors who value the asset most in one state differ from those who value it most in the other. Trading occurs as the asset is transferred across investors in the two different belief classes each time a transition to a different state occurs. The authors show that the price in <i>both</i> states is higher than it would be if investors were forced to hold the asset forever: there is a speculative premium that arises from the knowledge that someone else will, in due course and mistakenly in your opinion, value the asset more than you do.&nbsp;The contrast with the efficient markets hypothesis is striking and clear:<br /><blockquote>The basic tenet of fundamentalism, which goes back at least to J. B. Williams (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=lBROtwAACAAJ\">1938</a>), is that a stock has an intrinsic value related to the dividends it will pay, since a stock is a share in some enterprise and dividends represent the income that the enterprise gains for its owners. In one sense, we think that our analysis is consistent with the fundamentalist spirit, tempered by a subjectivist view of probability. Beginning with the view that stock prices are created by investors, and recognizing that investors may form different opinions even when they have the same substantive information, we contend that there can be no objective intrinsic value for the stock. Instead, we propose that the relevant notion of intrinsic value is obtained through market aggregation of diverse investor assessments. There are fundamentalist overtones in this position, since it is the market aggregation of investor attitudes and beliefs about future dividends with which we start. Under our assumptions, however, the aggregation process eventually yields prices with some curious characteristics. In particular, investors attach a higher value to ownership of the stock than they do to ownership of the dividend stream that it generates, which is not an immediately palatable conclusion from a fundamentalist point of view.</blockquote>The idea that prices are \"obtained through market aggregation of diverse investor assessments\" is not too far from Kay's more rhetorically powerful claim that they are \"the product of a clash between competing narratives\". &nbsp;What Harrison and Kreps do not consider is how diverse investor assessments change over time, since beliefs about transition probabilities are exogenously given in their analysis. But&nbsp;Kay's formulation suggests how progress on this front might be made. Beliefs change as some narratives gather influence relative to others, either though active persuasion (talking one's book for instance) or through differentials in profits accruing to those with different worldviews. While Kay is surely correct that a rich understanding of this process requires more than deductive reasoning, it is also true that deductive reasoning has not yet been pushed to its limits in facilitating our understanding of market dynamics.</div><br />") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Building a Better Dow") (content ((type . "html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>The following post, written jointly with <a href=\"http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/\">Debraj Ray</a>, is based on our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ssrn.com/abstract=2127890\">recent note</a>&nbsp;proposing a change in the method for computing the Dow.</i><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br />With a market capitalization approaching 600 billion, Apple is currently  the largest publicly traded company in the world. The previous  title-holder, Exxon Mobil, now stands far behind at 400 billion. But  Apple is not a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cp?s=^DJI\">component</a>&nbsp;of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Nor is  Google, with a higher valuation than all but a handful of firms in the  index. Meanwhile, firms with less than a tenth of Apple's market  capitalization, including Alcoa and Hewlett-Packard, continue to be  included. <br /><br />The exclusion of firms like Apple and Google would appear to undermine  the <a href=\"http://www.djaverages.com/?go=industrial-overview\">stated purpose</a>&nbsp;of the index, which is \"to provide a clear,  straightforward view of the stock market and, by extension, the U.S.  economy.\" But there are good reasons for such seemingly arbitrary  omissions. The Dow is a price-weighted index, and the average price of  its thirty components is currently around $58. Both Apple and Google  have share prices in excess of $600, and their inclusion would cause  day-to-day changes in the index to be driven largely by the behavior of  these two securities. For instance, their combined weight in the Dow  would be about 43% if they were to replace Alcoa and Travelers, which  are the two current components with the lowest valuations. Furthermore,  the index would become considerably more volatile even if the included  stocks were individually no more volatile than those they replace. As&nbsp;John Presbo,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://press.djindexes.com/index.php/bios/prestbo/\">chairman</a>&nbsp;of the index oversight committee, has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.djindexes.com/index.php/why-aapl-and-goog-arent-in-the-dow/\">observed</a>,&nbsp;such heavy dependence of the index on one or two stocks would \"hamper  its ability to accurately reflect the broader market.\"<br /><br />Indeed, price-weighting is decidedly an odd methodology. IBM has a  smaller market capitalization than Microsoft, but a substantially higher  share price. Under current conditions, a 1% change in the price of IBM  has an effect on the index that is almost seven times as great as a 1%  change in the price of Microsoft. In fact, IBM's weight in the index is  above 11%, although its valuation is less than 6% of the total among Dow  components. <br /><br />This issue does not arise with value-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P  500. But as Prestbo and others have pointed out, the Dow provides an  uninterrupted picture of stock market movements dating back to 1896. An  abrupt switch to value weighting would introduce a methodological  discontinuity that would \"essentially obliterate this history.\"  Attention has therefore been focused on the desirability of a stock  split, which would reduce Apple's share price to a level that could be  accommodated by the questionable methodology of the Dow. <br /><br />But an abrupt switch to a value weighting or the flawed artifice of a  stock split are not the only available alternatives. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ssrn.com/abstract=2127890\">recent paper</a>&nbsp;we propose a modification  that largely preserves the historical integrity of the Dow time series,  while allowing for the inclusion of securities regardless of their  market price. Our modified index also leads to a smooth and gradual  transition, as incumbent stocks are replaced, to a fully value-weighted  index in the long run. <br /><br />The proposed index is composed of two subindices, one price-weighted to  respect the internal structure of the Dow, and the other value-weighted  to apply to new entrants. The index has two parameters, both of which  are adjusted whenever a substitution is made. One of these maintains  continuity in the value of the index, while the other ensures that the  two subindices are weighted in proportion to their respective market  capitalizations. Stock splits require a change in parameters (as in the  case of the current Dow divisor) but only if the split occurs for a firm  in the price-weighted subindex. <br /><br />Once all incumbent firms are replaced, the result will be a fully  value-weighted index. In practice this could take several decades, as  some incumbent firms are likely to be remain components far into the  future. But firms in the price-weighted component of the index that  happen to have weights roughly commensurate with their market  capitalization can be transferred with no loss of continuity to the  value-weighted component. This procedure, which we call bridging, can  accelerate the transition to a value-weighted index with minimal  short-term disruption. Currently Coca Cola and Disney are prime  candidates for bridging. <br /><br />Under our proposed index, Apple would enter with a weight of less than  13% if it were to replace Alcoa. This is scarcely more than the weight  currently associated with IBM, a substantially smaller company. Adding  Google (in place of HP or Travelers) would further lower the weight of  Apple since the total market capitalization of Dow components would  rise. This is a relatively modest change that, we believe, would  simultaneously serve the desirable goals of methodological continuity  and market representativeness.</div>") (link ((rel .

"text")) "Market Overreaction: A Case Study") (content ((type . "html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">At 7:30pm yesterday the Drudge Report breathlessly <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/flashcm.htm\">broadcast</a> the following:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">ROMNEY NARROWS VP CHOICES; CONDI EMERGES AS FRONTRUNNER<br />Thu Jul 12 2012 19:30:01 ET&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">**Exclusive**&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Late Thursday evening, Mitt Romney's presidential campaign launched a new fundraising drive, 'Meet The VP' -- just as Romney himself has narrowed the field of candidates to a handful, sources reveal.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">And a surprise name is now near the top of the list: Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice!&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The timing of the announcement is now set for 'coming weeks'. </blockquote>The reaction on Intrade was immediate. The price of a contract that pays $10 if Rice is selected as Romney's running mate (and nothing otherwise) shot up from about 35 cents to $2, with about 2500 contracts changing hands within twenty minutes of the Drudge announcement. By the sleepy standards of the prediction market this constitutes very heavy volume. Nate Silver&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fivethirtyeight/status/223564648216133632\">responded</a>&nbsp;at 7:49 as follows:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The Condi Rice for VP contract at Intrade possibly the most obvious short since <a href=\"http://t.co/2fy0Aw0v\">Pets.com</a></blockquote>Good advice, as it turned out. By 9:45 pm the price had dropped to 90 cents a contract with about 5000 contracts traded in total since the initial announcement. Here's the price and volume chart:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OgK0CCQrIPA/T_-EEAk1aTI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/SMtkUqtD1BU/s1600/Rice.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"126\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OgK0CCQrIPA/T_-EEAk1aTI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/SMtkUqtD1BU/s400/Rice.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />One of the most interesting aspects of markets such as Intrade is that they offer sets of contracts on a list of exhaustive and mutually exclusive events. For instance, the Republican VP Nominee market contains not just the contract for Rice, but also for 56 other potential candidates, as well as a residual contract that pays off if none of the named contracts do. The sum of the bids for all these contracts cannot exceed $10, otherwise someone could sell the entire set of contracts and make an arbitrage profit. In practice, no individual is going to take the trouble to spot and exploit such opportunities, but it's a trivial matter to write a computer program that can do so as soon as they arise.<br /><br />In fact, such algorithms are in widespread use on Intrade, and easy to spot. The sharp rise in the Rice contract caused the arbitrage condition to be momentarily violated and&nbsp;simultaneous sales of the entire set of contracts began to occur. While the price of one contract rose, the prices of the others (Portman, Pawlenty, and Ryan especially) were knocked back as existing bids started to be filled by algorithmic instruction. But as new bidders appeared for these other contracts the Rice contract itself was pushed back in price, resulting in the reversal seen in the above chart. All this in a matter of two or three hours.<br /><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Does any of this have relevance for the far more economically significant markets for equity and debt? There's a fair amount of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2327804\">direct evidence</a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;that&nbsp;these markets are also characterized by overreaction to news, and such overreaction is consistent with&nbsp;</span>the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1802789\">excess volatility</a>&nbsp;of stock prices relative to dividend flows. But overreactions in stock and bond markets can take months or years to reverse. &nbsp;Benjamin Graham famously&nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=jxsiAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22interval+required+for+a+substantial+undervaluation+to+correct+itself%22\">claimed</a> that \"the interval required for a substantial undervaluation to correct itself averages approximately 1½ to 2½ years,\" and DeBondt and Thaler&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2327804\">found</a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;that \"loser\" portfolios (composed of stocks that had previously experienced sharp capital losses) continued to outperform \"winner\" portfolios (composed of those with significant prior capital gains) for up to five years after construction.<br /><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">One reason why overreaction to news in stock markets takes so long to correct is that there is no arbitrage constraint that forces a decline in other assets when one asset rises sharply in price.&nbsp;</span></span></span>In prediction markets, such constraints cause immediate reactions in related contracts as soon as one contract makes a major move. Similar effects arise in derivatives markets more generally:&nbsp;options prices respond instantly to changes in the price of the underlying, futures prices move in lock step with spot prices, and&nbsp;exchange-traded funds trade at prices that closely track those of their component securities. Most of this activity is generated by algorithms designed to sniff out and snap up opportunities for riskless profit. But&nbsp;the primitive assets in our economy, stocks and bonds, are constrained only by beliefs about their future values, and can therefore wander far and wide for long periods before being dragged back by their cash flow anchors.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br />Update (7/13).&nbsp;<a href=\"http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/07/sethi-a-case-study-of-market-overreaction.html\">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/07/rajiv-sethi-market-overreaction-a-case-study.html\">Yves Smith</a> have both reposted this, with interesting preludes. Here's Yves:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">I’d like to quibble with the notion that there is such a thing as a correct price for as vague a promise as a stock (by contrast, for derivatives, it is possible to determine a theoretical price in relationship to an actively traded underlying instrument, so even though the underlying may be misvalued, the derivative’s proper value given the current price and other parameters can be ascertained).&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Sethi suggests that stocks have “cash flow anchors”. I have trouble with that notion. A bond is a very specific obligation: to pay interest in specified amounts on specified dates, and to repay principal as of a date certain... By contrast, a stock is a very unsuitable instrument to be traded on an arm’s length, anonymous basis. A stock is a promise to pay dividends if the company makes enough money and the board is in the mood to do so. Yes, you have a vote, but your vote can be diluted at any time. There aren’t firm expectations of future cash flows; it’s all guess work and heuristics.</blockquote>I chose the term \"anchor\" with some care, because the rode of an anchor is not always taut.&nbsp;I didn't mean to suggest that there is a single proper value for a stock that can be unambiguously deduced from the available information; heterogeneity in the interpretation of information alone is enough to generate a broad range of valuations. This can allow for drift in various directions as long as the price doesn't become too far detached from earnings projections.<br /><br />Mark <a href=\"http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/07/sethi-a-case-study-of-market-overreaction.html\">argues</a> that the leak to Drudge was an attempt at distraction:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Rajiv Sethi looks at the reaction to the Romney campaign's attempt to change the subject from Romney's role at Bain to potential picks for vice-president (as far as I can tell, Rice has no chance -- she's \"mildly pro-choice\" for one -- so this was nothing more than an attempt to divert attention from Bain, an attempt one that seems to have worked, at least to some extent).</blockquote>This view, which seems to be held <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/223563130272362496\">left</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonahNRO/status/223735585645408258\">right</a>, was brilliantly summed up by&nbsp;Nate Silver <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fivethirtyeight/status/223548433150132225\">as follows</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">drudge (v.): To leak news to displace an unfavorable headline; to muddy up the news cycle.</blockquote>I was tempted to reply to Nate's tweet with:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">twartist (n.): One who is able by virtue of imagination and skill to create written works of aesthetic value in 140 characters or less.</blockquote>But it seems that the term is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/feb/23/art-twitter-twart\">already in use</a>.<br /><br /></div>") (link ((rel .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This brief <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqFaZUOhhw\">segment</a> from a recent speech by Joe Stiglitz sums up very neatly the nature of our current economic predicament (emphasis added):<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We should realize that the resources in our economy... today is the same is at was five years ago. We have the same human capital, the same physical capital, the same natural capital, the same knowledge... the same creativity... we have all these strengths, they haven't disappeared. What has happened is, <i>we're having a fight over claims, claims to resources</i>. We've created more liabilities... but these are just paper. Liabilities are claims on these resources. But the resources are﻿ there. <i>And the fight over the claims is interfering with our use of the resources</i>.&nbsp;</blockquote>I think this is a very useful way to think about the potential effectiveness under current conditions of various policy proposals, including conventional fiscal and monetary stabilization policies.<br /><br />Part of the reason for our anemic and fitful recovery is that contested claims, especially in the housing market, continue to be settled in a chaotic and extremely wasteful manner. Recovery from subprime foreclosures is typically a small fraction of outstanding principal, and properly calibrated <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">principal write-downs</a> can often benefit <i>both</i> borrowers and lenders. Modifications that would occur routinely under the traditional bilateral model of lending are much harder to implement when lenders are holders of complex structured claims on the revenues generated by mortgage payments. Direct contact between lenders and borrowers is neither legal nor practicable in this case, and the power to make modifications lies instead with servicers. But servicer incentives are not properly aligned with those of the lenders on whose behalf they collect and process payments. The result is foreclosure even when modification would be much less destructive of resources.<br /><br />Despite some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2012/06/home-sales-reports-what-matters.html\">indications</a>&nbsp;that home values are starting to rise again, the steady flow of <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-foreclosure-starts-2012-6\">defaults and foreclosures</a>&nbsp;shows no sign of abating. Any policy that stands a chance of getting us back to pre-recession levels of resource utilization has to result in the quick and orderly settlement of these claims, with or without modification of the original contractual terms. And it's not clear to me that the blunt instruments of conventional stabilization policy can accomplish this.<br /><br />Consider monetary policy for instance. The clamor for more aggressive action by the Fed has recently become deafening, with a long and distinguished line of advocates (see, for instance, recent posts by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/26167477428/future-heroes-of-humanity-and-heroes-of-japan\">Miles Kimball</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2012/06/guest_contribut_18.html\">Joseph Gagnon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/06/monetary-policy-1\">Ryan Avent</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=15095\">Scott Sumner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/opinion/krugman-the-great-abdication.html\">Paul Krugman</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2012/06/where-to-next.html\">Tim Duy</a>). While the various proposals differ with respect to details the idea seems to be the following: (i) the Fed has the capacity to increase inflation and nominal GDP should it choose to do so, (ii) this can be accomplished by asset purchases on a large enough scale, and (iii) doing this would increase not only inflation and nominal GDP but also output and employment.<br /><br />It's the third part of this argument with which I have some difficulty, because I don't see how it would help resolve the fight over claims that is crippling our recovery.&nbsp;Higher inflation can certainly reduce the real value of outstanding debt in an accounting sense, but this doesn't mean that distressed borrowers will be able to meet their obligations at the originally contracted terms. In order for them to do so, it is necessary that&nbsp;<i>their</i> nominal income rises, not just nominal income in the aggregate. And monetary policy via asset purchases would seem to put money disproportionately in the pockets of existing asset holders, who are more likely to be creditors than debtors. Put differently, while the Fed has the capacity to raise nominal income, it does not have much control over the manner in which this increment is distributed across the population. And the distribution matters.<br /><br />Similar issues arise with inflation.&nbsp;Inflation is just the growth rate of an index number, a weighted average of prices for a broad range of goods and services.&nbsp;The Fed can certainly raise the growth rate of this average, but has virtually no control over its individual components. That is, it cannot increase the inflation rate without simultaneously affecting <i>relative</i> prices. For instance,&nbsp;purchases of assets that drive down long term interest rates&nbsp;will lead to portfolio shifts and an increase in the price of commodities, which are now an actively traded asset class. This in turn will raise input costs for some firms more than others, and these cost increases will affect wages and prices to varying degrees depending on competitive conditions. As Dan Alpert has <a href=\"http://www.economonitor.com/danalperts2cents/2012/04/25/earth-to-paul-krugman/\">argued</a>,&nbsp;expansionary monetary policy under these conditions could even \"collapse economic activity, as limited per capita wages are shunted to oil and food, rather than to more expansionary forms of consumption.\"<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest that more aggressive action by the Fed is unwarranted or would necessarily be counterproductive, just that it needs to be supplemented by policies designed to secure the&nbsp;rapid and efficient settlement of conflicting claims.<br /><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">One of the most interesting proposals of this kind was&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html\">floated</a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;back in October 2008 by&nbsp;John Geanakoplos and Susan Koniak, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html\">second article</a> a few months later expanded on the original. It's worth examining the idea in detail. First,</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">deadweight losses</a> arising from foreclosure are substantial:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For subprime and other non-prime loans, which account for more than half of all foreclosures, the best thing to do for the homeowners and for the bondholders is to write down principal far enough so that each homeowner will have equity in his house and thus an incentive to pay and not default again down the line...&nbsp;there is room to make generous principal reductions, without hurting bondholders and without spending a dime of taxpayer money, because the bond markets expect so little out of foreclosures. Typically, a homeowner fights off eviction for 18 months, making no mortgage or tax payments and no repairs. Abandoned homes are often stripped and vandalized. Foreclosure and reselling expenses are so high the subprime bond market trades now as if it expects only 25 percent back on a loan when there is a foreclosure.</blockquote>Second, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">securitization</a> precludes direct contact between borrowers and lenders:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In the old days, a mortgage loan involved only two parties, a borrower and a bank. If the borrower ran into difficulty, it was in the bank’s interest to ease the homeowner’s burden and adjust the terms of the loan. When housing prices fell drastically, bankers renegotiated, helping to stabilize the market.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The world of securitization changed that, especially for subprime mortgages. There is no longer any equivalent of “the bank” that has an incentive to rework failing loans. The loans are pooled together, and the pooled mortgage payments are divided up among many securities according to complicated rules. A party called a “master servicer” manages the pools of loans. The security holders are effectively the lenders, but legally they are prohibited from contacting the homeowners.</blockquote>Third, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">incentives</a> of servicers are not aligned with those of lenders:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Why are the master servicers not doing what an old-fashioned banker would do? Because a servicer has very different incentives. Most anything a master servicer does to rework a loan will create big winners but also some big losers among the security holders to whom the servicer holds equal duties... By allowing foreclosures to proceed without much intervention, they avoid potentially huge lawsuits by injured security holders.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">On top of the legal risks, reworking loans can be costly for master servicers. They need to document what new monthly payment a homeowner can afford and assess fluctuating property values to determine whether foreclosing would yield more or less than reworking. It’s costly just to track down the distressed homeowners, who are understandably inclined to ignore calls from master servicers that they sense may be all too eager to foreclose.</blockquote>And finally, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">proposed solution</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To solve this problem, we propose legislation that moves the reworking function from the paralyzed master servicers and transfers it to community-based, government-appointed trustees. These trustees would be given no information about which securities are derived from which mortgages, or how those securities would be affected by the reworking and foreclosure decisions they make.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Instead of worrying about which securities might be harmed, the blind trustees would consider, loan by loan, whether a reworking would bring in more money than a foreclosure... The trustees would be hired from the ranks of community bankers, and thus have the expertise the judiciary lacks...&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our plan does not require that the loans be reassembled from the securities in which they are now divided, nor does it require the buying up of any loans or securities. It does require the transfer of the servicers’ duty to rework loans to government trustees. It requires that restrictions in some servicing contracts, like those on how many loans can be reworked in each pool, be eliminated when the duty to rework is transferred to the trustees...&nbsp;Once the trustees have examined the loans — leaving some unchanged, reworking others and recommending foreclosure on the rest — they would pass those decisions to the government clearing house for transmittal back to the appropriate servicers...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our plan would keep many more Americans in their homes, and put government money into local communities where it would make a difference. By clarifying the true value of each loan, it would also help clarify the value of securities associated with those mortgages, enabling investors to trade them again. Most important, our plan would help stabilize housing prices.</blockquote>As with any proposal dealing with a problem of such magnitude and complexity, there are downsides to this. Anticipation of modification could induce borrowers who are underwater but current with their payments to default strategically in order to secure reductions in principal. Such policy-induced default could be mitigated by ensuring that only truly distressed households qualify. But since current financial distress is in part a reflection of past decisions regarding consumption and saving, some are sure to find the distributional effects of the policy galling.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it seems that something along these lines needs to be attempted if we are to get back to pre-recession levels of resource utilization anytime soon. And the urgency of action does seem to be&nbsp;getting&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/business/economy/real-estates-collective-action-problem.html\">renewed attention</a>.<br /><br />The bottom line, I think, is this: too much faith in the traditional tools of macroeconomic stabilization under current conditions is misplaced. One can conceive of dramatically different approaches to monetary policy, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/918.html\">direct</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/\">transfers</a>&nbsp;to households, but these would surely face insurmountable legal and political obstacles. It is essential, therefore, that macroeconomic stabilization be supplemented by policies that&nbsp;are microeconomically detailed, fine grained, and directly confront the problem of balance sheet repair. Otherwise this enormously costly fight over claims will continue to impede the use of our resources for many more years to come.</div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his timeless classic&nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC\">The Strategy of Conflict</a>, Thomas Schelling began a chapter on the&nbsp;\"reciprocal fear of surprise attack\" as follows:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">If I go downstairs to investigate a noise at night, with a gun in my hand, and find myself face to face with a burglar who has a gun in his hand, there is a danger of an outcome that neither of us desires. Even if he prefers to just leave quietly, and I wish him to, there is danger that he may <i>think</i> I want to shoot, and shoot first. Worse, there is danger that he may think that <i>I</i> think <i>he</i> wants to shoot. Or he may think that <i>I</i> think <i>he</i> thinks <i>I</i> want to shoot. And so on. \"Self-Defense\" is ambiguous, when one is only trying to preclude being shot in self-defense.</blockquote><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">This effect is empirically important, and is part of the reason why homicide rates vary so greatly across otherwise similar locations, and can change so sharply over time at a given location.&nbsp;In our attempt to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;why the Newark homicide rate doubled in just six years from 2000-2006 while the national rate remained essentially constant,&nbsp;Dan O'Flaherty and I&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11847\">found</a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;a substantial number of homicides to be the outcome of escalating disputes between strangers or acquaintances often over seemingly trivial matters.&nbsp;High rates of homicide make for a tense and fearful environment within which the preemptive motive for killing starts to loom large, and this itself reinforces the cycle of tension, fear, and continued killing.&nbsp;</span>Incremental reductions in homicide under such circumstances are unlikely to be feasible, but sudden large scale reductions that transform the environment and break the cycle can sometimes be attained. Similar effects arise with international <a href=\"http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/2/351.short\">arms races</a>.<br /><br />In the jargon of economics, homicide is characterized by <i>strategic complementarity</i>: any increase in the willingness of one set of individuals to kill will be amplified by increases in the willingness of others to kill preemptively, and so on, in an expectations driven cascade. Any change in fundamentals can set this process off, such as a breakdown in law enforcement, easier availability of firearms, or increases in the value of a contested resource.<br /><br />The logic of strategic complementarity implies that a broadening of the notion of justifiable homicide, in an attempt to benefit potential victims of crime, can have tragic and entirely counterproductive effects.&nbsp;Florida's 2005 stand-your-ground law is an example of this, and more than twenty other states have adopted similar legislation in its wake. These are sometimes called castle doctrine laws, since they extend to other locations the principle that one does not have a duty to retreat in one's own home (or \"castle\").<br /><br />Enough time has elapsed since the passage of these laws for an empirical analysis of their effects to be be conducted, and a recent <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18134\">paper</a> by&nbsp;Cheng and Hoekstra does exactly this.&nbsp;Determining the <i>causal</i> effects of any change in the legal environment is always a tricky business. The authors tackle the problem by grouping states into those that adopted such laws and those that did not, and comparing&nbsp;<i>within-state</i> changes in outcomes across the two groups of states (the so-called difference in differences identification strategy).&nbsp;Their findings are striking:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Results indicate that the prospect of facing additional self-defense does not deter crime. Specifically, we find no evidence of deterrence effects on burglary, robbery, or aggravated assault. Moreover, our estimates are sufficiently precise as to rule out meaningful deterrence effects.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In contrast, we find significant evidence that the laws increase homicides... the laws increase murder and manslaughter by a statistically significant 7 to 9 percent, which translates into an additional 500 to 700 homicides per year nationally across the states that adopted castle doctrine. Thus, by lowering the expected costs associated with using lethal force, castle doctrine laws induce more of it... murder alone is increased by a statistically significant 6 to 11 percent. This is important because murder excludes non-negligent manslaughter classifications that one might think are used more frequently in self-defense cases. But regardless of how one interprets increases from various classifications, it is clear that the primary effect of strengthening self-defense law is to increase homicide.</blockquote>These are statistical findings and refer to aggregate effects; no individual homicide can be attributed with certainty to a change in the legal environment, not even the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/us/justice-department-opens-inquiry-in-killing-of-trayvon-martin.html\">one killing</a> that has brought castle doctrine laws into national focus. Nevertheless, we now have&nbsp;compelling evidence that the adoption of such laws has led directly to several hundred deaths annually nationwide, with negligible deterrence effects on other crimes. While the latter finding may be surprising, the former should have been entirely predictable.</div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The political scientist Elinor Ostrom, co-recipient of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics, <a href=\"http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/22577.html\">died this morning</a> at the age of 78. I met her just once, after a talk she gave at Columbia sometime in the 1990s. It was in a very interesting seminar series organized by Dick Nelson if I recall correctly.<br /><br />I was a great admirer of Ostrom's research on common pool resources, and tried to interpret some of her insights from an evolutionary perspective in some <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2118304\">joint work</a> with E. Somanathan a while ago. I've written about her here on a couple of occasions, and once reviewed a <a href=\"http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=10728\">book</a>&nbsp;that was largely a celebration of her vision (she had a hand in no less than six chapters).<br /><br />Here are some extracts from a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/choice-of-elinor-ostrom-as-co-recipient.html\">post</a> written soon after the Nobel announcement:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Ostrom’s extensive research on local governance has shattered the myth of inevitability surrounding the “tragedy of the commons” and curtailed the uncritical application of the free-rider hypothesis to collective action problems. Prior to her work it was widely believed that scarce natural resources such as forests and fisheries would be wastefully used and degraded or exhausted under common ownership, and therefore had to be either state owned or held as private property in order to be efficiently managed. Ostrom demonstrated that self-governance was possible when a group of users had collective rights to the resource, including the right to exclude outsiders, and the capacity to enforce rules and norms through a system of decentralized monitoring and sanctions. This is clearly a finding of considerable practical significance.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">As importantly, the award recognized an approach to research that is practically extinct in contemporary economics. Ostrom developed her ideas by reading and generalizing from a vast number of case studies of forests, fisheries, groundwater basins, irrigation systems, and pastures.  Her work is rich in institutional detail and interdisciplinary to the core. She used game theoretic models and laboratory experiments to refine her ideas, but historical and institutional analysis was central to this effort.  She deviated from standard economic assumptions about rationality and self-interest when she felt that such assumptions were at variance with observed behavior, and did so long before behavioral economics was in fashion...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">There is no doubt that her research has dramatically transformed our thinking about the feasibility and efficiency of common property regimes. In addition, it serves as a reminder that her eclectic and interdisciplinary approach to social science can be enormously fruitful. In making this selection at this time, it is conceivable that the Nobel Committee is sending a message that methodological pluralism is something our discipline would do well to restore, preserve and foster.</blockquote>And from the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016726810200197X\">book review</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Although several distinguished scholars have been affiliated with the workshop over the years, Ostrom remains its leading light and creative force. It is fitting, therefore, that the book concludes with her 1988 Presidential Address to the American Political Science Association. In this chapter, she identifies serious shortcomings in prevailing theories of collective action. Approaches based on the hypothesis of unbounded rationality and material self-interest often predict a “tragedy of the commons” and prescribe either privatization of common property or its appropriation by the state. Policies based on such theories, in her view, “have been subject to major failure and have exacerbated the very problems they were intended to ameliorate”. What is required, instead, is an approach to collective action that places reciprocity, reputation and trust at its core. Any such theory must take into account our evolved capacity to learn norms of reciprocity, and must incorporate a theory of boundedly rational and moral behavior. It is only in such terms that the effects of communication on behavior can be understood. Communication is effective in fostering cooperation, in Ostrom’s view, because it allows subjects to build trust, form group identities, reinforce reciprocity norms, and establish mutual commitment. The daunting task of building rigorous models of economic and political choice in which reciprocity and trust play a meaningful role is only just beginning...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The key conclusions drawn by the contributors are nuanced and carefully qualified, but certain policy implications do emerge from the analysis. The most important of these is that local communities can often find autonomous and effective solutions to collective-action problems when markets and states fail to do so. Such institutions of self-governance are fragile: large-scale interventions, even when well-intentioned, can disrupt and damage local governance structures, often resulting in unanticipated welfare losses. When a history of successful community resource management is in evidence, significant interventions should be made with caution. Once destroyed, evolved institutions are every bit as difficult to reconstruct as natural ecosystems, and a strong case can be made for conserving those that achieve acceptable levels of efficiency and equity. By ignoring the possibility of self-governance, one puts too much faith in the benevolence of a national government that is too large for local problems and too small for global ones. Moreover, as Ostrom points out in the concluding chapter, by teaching successive generations that the solution to collective-action problems lie either in the market or in the state, “we may be creating the very conditions that undermine our democratic way of life”. The stakes could not be higher.</blockquote>Earlier tributes to Ostrom from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-commons-nobel-economics-opinions-contributors-vernon-l-smith.html\">Vernon Smith</a> and <a href=\"http://chartercities.org/blog/72/skyhooks-versus-cranes-the-nobel-prize-for-elinor-ostrom\">Paul Romer</a>&nbsp;are well worth revisiting.</div>") (link ((rel .

If the intermediary were simply absent from the marketplace, a trade would occur between the parties virtually instantaneously at a single price that is acceptable to both. Instead, both parties trade against the intermediary, at different prices. The intermediary captures the spread at the expense of the parties who wish to transact, adds nothing to liquidity in the market for the asset, and doubles the notional volume of trade.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/451329576040275968\">first example</a> may be summarized as follows. A hundred thousand shares in a company have been offered for sale at a specified price across multiple exchanges. A single buyer wishes to purchase the whole lot and is willing to pay the asked price. He places a single buy order to this effect. The order first reaches BATS, where it is partially filled for ten thousand shares; it is then routed to the other exchanges for completion. An intermediary, having seen the original buy order on arrival at BATS, places orders to buy the remaining ninety thousand shares on the other exchanges. This latter order travels faster and trades first, so the original buyer receives only partial fulfillment. The intermediary immediately posts offers to sell ninety thousand shares at a slightly higher price, which the original buyer is likely to accept. All this in a matter of milliseconds.<br /><br />The intermediary here is serving no useful economic function. Volume is significantly higher than it otherwise would have been, but there has been no increase in market liquidity. Had there been no intermediary present, the buyer and sellers would have transacted without any discernible delay, at a price that would have been better for the buyer and no worse for the sellers. Furthermore, an order is allowed to trade ahead of one that made its first contact with the market at an earlier point in time.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/452821826452733952\">second example</a>&nbsp;involves interactions between a dark pool and the public markets. Suppose that the highest bid price for a stock in the public exchanges is $100.00, and the lowest ask is $100.10. An individual submits a bid for a thousand shares at $100.05 to a dark pool, where it remains invisible and awaits a matching order. Shortly thereafter, a sell order for a thousand shares at $100.01 is placed at a public exchange. These orders are compatible and should trade against each other at a single price. Instead, both trade against an intermediary, which buys at the lower price, sells at the higher price, and captures the spread.<br /><br />As in the first example, the intermediary is not providing any benefit to either transacting party, and is not adding liquidity to the market for the asset. Volume is doubled but no economic purpose is served. Transactions that were about to occur anyway are preempted by a fraction of a second, and a net transfer of resources from investors to intermediaries is the only lasting consequence.<br /><br />Michael Lewis has focused on practices such as these because their social wastefulness and fundamental unfairness is so transparent. But it's important to recognize that most of the strategies implemented by high frequency trading firms may not be quite so easy to classify or condemn.

"text")) "Superfluous Financial Intermediation") (content ((type . "html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">I'm only about halfway through <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=UcIkAwAAQBAJ\">Flash Boys</a> but have already come across a couple of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/451329576040275968\">striking</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/452821826452733952\">examples</a> of what might charitably be called <i>superfluous financial intermediation</i>. <br /><br />This is the practice of inserting oneself between a buyer and a seller of an asset, when both parties have <i>already communicated</i> to the market a willingness to trade at a mutually acceptable price. If the intermediary were simply absent from the marketplace, a trade would occur between the parties virtually instantaneously at a single price that is acceptable to both. Instead, both parties trade against the intermediary, at different prices. The intermediary captures the spread at the expense of the parties who wish to transact, adds nothing to liquidity in the market for the asset, and doubles the notional volume of trade.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/451329576040275968\">first example</a> may be summarized as follows. A hundred thousand shares in a company have been offered for sale at a specified price across multiple exchanges. A single buyer wishes to purchase the whole lot and is willing to pay the asked price. He places a single buy order to this effect. The order first reaches BATS, where it is partially filled for ten thousand shares; it is then routed to the other exchanges for completion. An intermediary, having seen the original buy order on arrival at BATS, places orders to buy the remaining ninety thousand shares on the other exchanges. This latter order travels faster and trades first, so the original buyer receives only partial fulfillment. The intermediary immediately posts offers to sell ninety thousand shares at a slightly higher price, which the original buyer is likely to accept. All this in a matter of milliseconds.<br /><br />The intermediary here is serving no useful economic function. Volume is significantly higher than it otherwise would have been, but there has been no increase in market liquidity. Had there been no intermediary present, the buyer and sellers would have transacted without any discernible delay, at a price that would have been better for the buyer and no worse for the sellers. Furthermore, an order is allowed to trade ahead of one that made its first contact with the market at an earlier point in time.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/452821826452733952\">second example</a>&nbsp;involves interactions between a dark pool and the public markets. Suppose that the highest bid price for a stock in the public exchanges is $100.00, and the lowest ask is $100.10. An individual submits a bid for a thousand shares at $100.05 to a dark pool, where it remains invisible and awaits a matching order. Shortly thereafter, a sell order for a thousand shares at $100.01 is placed at a public exchange. These orders are compatible and should trade against each other at a single price. Instead, both trade against an intermediary, which buys at the lower price, sells at the higher price, and captures the spread.<br /><br />As in the first example, the intermediary is not providing any benefit to either transacting party, and is not adding liquidity to the market for the asset. Volume is doubled but no economic purpose is served. Transactions that were about to occur anyway are preempted by a fraction of a second, and a net transfer of resources from investors to intermediaries is the only lasting consequence.<br /><br />Michael Lewis has focused on practices such as these because their social wastefulness and fundamental unfairness is so transparent. But it's important to recognize that most of the strategies implemented by high frequency trading firms may not be quite so easy to classify or condemn. For instance, how is one to evaluate trading based on short term price forecasts based on genuinely public information? I have tried to argue in earlier posts that the proliferation of such <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/blame-instructions-not-machines.html\">information extracting strategies</a> can give rise to greater price volatility.

The main goal of that work was to try to examine the manner in which new information is transmitted to asset prices, and to distinguish empirically between two <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210\">influential</a> <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">theories</a> of trading. To accomplish this we examined in close detail every transaction on Intrade over the two week period immediately preceding the 2012 presidential election. We looked at about 84,000 transactions involving 3.5 million contracts and over 3,200 unique accounts, and in the process of doing so quickly realized that a single trader was responsible for about a third of all bets on Romney to win, and had wagered and lost close to 4 million dollars in just this one fortnight. &nbsp; <br /><br />While this discovery was (and remains) incidental to the main message of the paper, it has attracted a great deal of media attention over the past couple of days. (About a dozen articles are linked <a href=\"http://www.barnard.edu/news/research-prof-rajiv-sethi-examines-betting-during-2012-presidential-election\">here</a>, and there have been a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101062237\">couple</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/09/25/romney-backer-lost-4-million-plus-on-intrade-in-possible-manipulation-attempt-researchers/\">more</a>&nbsp;published since.) Most of these reports state the basic facts and make some conjectures about motivation. The purpose of this post is to describe and interpret what we found in a bit more detail. Much of what is said here can also be found in Section 5 of the paper.<br /><br />To begin with, the discovery of a large trader with significant exposure to a Romney loss was not a surprise. There was discussion of a possible \"Romney Whale\" in the Intrade chat rooms and elsewhere leading up to the election, as well as open recognition of the possibility of arbitrage with Betfair. On the afternoon of election day I noticed that the order book for Romney contracts was unusually asymmetric, with the number of bids far exceeding the number of offers, and posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">this</a>:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oNfraAyAJLw/UkO-dgxs6XI/AAAAAAAAB-k/Vw7HqCZ7Qns/s1600/tweet.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oNfraAyAJLw/UkO-dgxs6XI/AAAAAAAAB-k/Vw7HqCZ7Qns/s400/tweet.png\" width=\"290\" /></a></div><br />This was circulated quite widely thanks to the following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinwolfers/status/265923012610650112\">response</a>:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b-fgXd0LxSg/UkO-j_c7MCI/AAAAAAAAB-w/zWh2YIjR47c/s1600/wolferstweet.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b-fgXd0LxSg/UkO-j_c7MCI/AAAAAAAAB-w/zWh2YIjR47c/s400/wolferstweet.png\" width=\"288\" /></a></div><br />In a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">post</a>&nbsp;on the following day I explained why I thought that is was an attempt at manipulation:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Could this not have been just a big bet, placed by someone optimistic about Romney's chances? I don't think so, for two reasons. First, if one wanted to bet on Romney rather than Obama, much better odds were available elsewhere, for instance on Betfair. More importantly, one would not want to leave such large orders standing at a time when new information was emerging rapidly; the risk of having the orders met by someone with superior information would be too great. Yet these orders stood for hours, and effectively placed a floor on the Romney price and a ceiling on the price for Obama.</blockquote>Ron Bernstein at Intrade has <a href=\"https://www.intrade.com/v4/home/\">explained</a>&nbsp;why the disparity with Betfair is not surprising given the severe constraints faced by US residents in opening and operating accounts at the latter exchange, and the differential fee structure. Nevertheless, I still find the second explanation compelling.<br /><br />The strategic manner in which these orders were placed, with large bids at steadily declining intervals, suggested to me that this was an experienced trader making efficient use of the available funds to order to have the maximum price impact. The orders lower down on the bid side of the book served as deterrents, revealing to counterparties that a sale at the best bid would not result in a price collapse. This is why I described the trader as sophisticated in my conversations with reporters at the <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/23/one-big-trader-lost-millions-betting-on-romney-study-finds/\">WSJ</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/study-bettor-lost-4m-on-mitt-romney-97269.html?hp=r6\">Politico</a>. &nbsp;Characterizing his behavior as <a href=\"http://gawker.com/which-stupid-millionaire-lost-a-fortune-betting-on-mitt-1377376456\">stupid</a> presumes that this was a series of bets made with in the conviction that Romney would prevail, which I doubt.<br /><br />But if this was an attempt to manipulate prices, what was it's purpose? We consider a couple of different possibilities in the paper. The one that has been most widely reported is that it was at attempt to boost campaign contributions, morale, and turnout. But there's another very different possibility that's worth considering.<br /><br />On the afternoon of the 2004 presidential election exit polls were leaked that suggested a surprise victory by John Kerry, and the result was a sharp rise in the price of his Tradesports contract. (Tradesports was a precursor to Intrade.) This was sustained for several hours until election returns began to come in that were not consistent with the reported polls. In an interesting <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25098859\">study</a> published in 2007, Snowberg, Wolfers and Zitzewitz used this event to examine the effects on the S&amp;P futures market of beliefs about the electoral outcome. They found that perceptions of a Kerry victory resulted in a decline in the price of the index, an effect they interpreted as causal. The following chart from their paper makes the point quite vividly:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uoxC2qn1QLI/UkPIwiHmUdI/AAAAAAAAB_A/hIX9x8UkyKQ/s1600/Snowberg.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uoxC2qn1QLI/UkPIwiHmUdI/AAAAAAAAB_A/hIX9x8UkyKQ/s400/Snowberg.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Motivated in part by this finding, we wondered whether the manipulation of beliefs about the electoral outcome could have been motivated by financial gain. If Intrade could be used to manipulate beliefs in a manner that affected the value a stock price index, or specific securities such as health or oil and gas stocks, then a four million dollar loss could be easily compensated by a much larger gain elsewhere. Could this have provided motivation for the behavior of our large trader?<br /><br />We decided that this was extremely unlikely, for two reasons. First, the 2004 analysis showed only that changes in beliefs affected the index, not that the Intrade price caused the change in beliefs. In fact, it was the leaked exit polls that affected both the Intrade price and the S&amp;P 500 futures market. This does not mean that a change in the Intrade price, absent confirming evidence from elsewhere, could not have a causal impact on other asset prices. It's possible that it could, but not plausible in our estimation.<br /><br />Furthermore, the partisan effects identified by Snowberg et al. were completely absent in 2012. In fact, if anything, the effects were reversed. S&amp;P 500 futures reacted <i>negatively</i> to an increase in perceptions of a Romney victory during the first debate, and <i>positively</i> to the announcement of the result on election day. One possible reason is that monetary policy was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/business/debating-the-elections-cause-and-effect-on-wall-street.html\">expected</a> to be tighter under a Romney administration. Here is the chart for the first debate:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kDxuekHj2n8/UkPM4ac_i2I/AAAAAAAAB_U/2arUA32lrl8/s1600/FirstDebate_5PM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"245\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kDxuekHj2n8/UkPM4ac_i2I/AAAAAAAAB_U/2arUA32lrl8/s400/FirstDebate_5PM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />The index falls as Romney's prospects appear to be rising, but the effect is clearly minor. The main point is that any attempt to use 2004 correlations to influence the S&amp;P via changes in Intrade prices, even if they were successful in altering beliefs about the election, would have been futile or counterproductive from the perspective of financial gain.<br /><br />This is why we ultimately decided that this trader's activity was simply a form of support to the campaign. While four million dollars is a fortune for most of us, it is less than the cost of making and airing a primetime commercial in a major media market. In the age of multi-billion dollar political campaigns, it really is a drop in the bucket. Even if the impact on perceptions was small, it's not clear to me that there was an alternative use of this money at this late stage that would have had a greater impact. Certainly television commercials had been largely tuned out by this point.<br /><br />It's important to keep in mind that attempts at manipulation notwithstanding, real money peer-to-peer prediction markets have been <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574072207000807\">very effective</a> in forecasting outcomes over the two decades in which they have been in use. Furthermore, as I hope my paper with David demonstrates, the simplicity of the binary option contract makes the data from such markets valuable for academic research. It is true that participation in these markets is a form of gambling, but that is also the case for many short-horizon traders in markets for more traditional assets, especially options, futures and swaps. The volume of speculation in such markets exceeds the demands for hedging by an order of magnitude. From a regulatory standpoint, there is really no rational basis for treating prediction markets differently.</div>" "http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/feeds/4105817708277285744/comments/default" (21061 34619) old 3 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4039434.post-4105817708277285744") (published nil "2013-09-26T02:29:00.001-04:00") (updated nil "2013-09-27T09:25:15.386-04:00") (title ((type .

The main goal of that work was to try to examine the manner in which new information is transmitted to asset prices, and to distinguish empirically between two <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210\">influential</a> <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">theories</a> of trading. To accomplish this we examined in close detail every transaction on Intrade over the two week period immediately preceding the 2012 presidential election. We looked at about 84,000 transactions involving 3.5 million contracts and over 3,200 unique accounts, and in the process of doing so quickly realized that a single trader was responsible for about a third of all bets on Romney to win, and had wagered and lost close to 4 million dollars in just this one fortnight. &nbsp; <br /><br />While this discovery was (and remains) incidental to the main message of the paper, it has attracted a great deal of media attention over the past couple of days. (About a dozen articles are linked <a href=\"http://www.barnard.edu/news/research-prof-rajiv-sethi-examines-betting-during-2012-presidential-election\">here</a>, and there have been a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101062237\">couple</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/09/25/romney-backer-lost-4-million-plus-on-intrade-in-possible-manipulation-attempt-researchers/\">more</a>&nbsp;published since.) Most of these reports state the basic facts and make some conjectures about motivation. The purpose of this post is to describe and interpret what we found in a bit more detail. Much of what is said here can also be found in Section 5 of the paper.<br /><br />To begin with, the discovery of a large trader with significant exposure to a Romney loss was not a surprise. There was discussion of a possible \"Romney Whale\" in the Intrade chat rooms and elsewhere leading up to the election, as well as open recognition of the possibility of arbitrage with Betfair. On the afternoon of election day I noticed that the order book for Romney contracts was unusually asymmetric, with the number of bids far exceeding the number of offers, and posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">this</a>:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oNfraAyAJLw/UkO-dgxs6XI/AAAAAAAAB-k/Vw7HqCZ7Qns/s1600/tweet.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oNfraAyAJLw/UkO-dgxs6XI/AAAAAAAAB-k/Vw7HqCZ7Qns/s400/tweet.png\" width=\"290\" /></a></div><br />This was circulated quite widely thanks to the following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinwolfers/status/265923012610650112\">response</a>:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b-fgXd0LxSg/UkO-j_c7MCI/AAAAAAAAB-w/zWh2YIjR47c/s1600/wolferstweet.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b-fgXd0LxSg/UkO-j_c7MCI/AAAAAAAAB-w/zWh2YIjR47c/s400/wolferstweet.png\" width=\"288\" /></a></div><br />In a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">post</a>&nbsp;on the following day I explained why I thought that is was an attempt at manipulation:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Could this not have been just a big bet, placed by someone optimistic about Romney's chances? I don't think so, for two reasons. First, if one wanted to bet on Romney rather than Obama, much better odds were available elsewhere, for instance on Betfair. More importantly, one would not want to leave such large orders standing at a time when new information was emerging rapidly; the risk of having the orders met by someone with superior information would be too great. Yet these orders stood for hours, and effectively placed a floor on the Romney price and a ceiling on the price for Obama.</blockquote>Ron Bernstein at Intrade has <a href=\"https://www.intrade.com/v4/home/\">explained</a>&nbsp;why the disparity with Betfair is not surprising given the severe constraints faced by US residents in opening and operating accounts at the latter exchange, and the differential fee structure. Nevertheless, I still find the second explanation compelling.<br /><br />The strategic manner in which these orders were placed, with large bids at steadily declining intervals, suggested to me that this was an experienced trader making efficient use of the available funds to order to have the maximum price impact. The orders lower down on the bid side of the book served as deterrents, revealing to counterparties that a sale at the best bid would not result in a price collapse. This is why I described the trader as sophisticated in my conversations with reporters at the <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/23/one-big-trader-lost-millions-betting-on-romney-study-finds/\">WSJ</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/study-bettor-lost-4m-on-mitt-romney-97269.html?hp=r6\">Politico</a>. &nbsp;Characterizing his behavior as <a href=\"http://gawker.com/which-stupid-millionaire-lost-a-fortune-betting-on-mitt-1377376456\">stupid</a> presumes that this was a series of bets made with in the conviction that Romney would prevail, which I doubt.<br /><br />But if this was an attempt to manipulate prices, what was it's purpose? We consider a couple of different possibilities in the paper. The one that has been most widely reported is that it was at attempt to boost campaign contributions, morale, and turnout. But there's another very different possibility that's worth considering.<br /><br />On the afternoon of the 2004 presidential election exit polls were leaked that suggested a surprise victory by John Kerry, and the result was a sharp rise in the price of his Tradesports contract. (Tradesports was a precursor to Intrade.) This was sustained for several hours until election returns began to come in that were not consistent with the reported polls. In an interesting <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25098859\">study</a> published in 2007, Snowberg, Wolfers and Zitzewitz used this event to examine the effects on the S&amp;P futures market of beliefs about the electoral outcome.

Markets may <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2327804\">overreact</a> at times but they seldom fail to react at all, and the time lag between the emergence of information and an adjustment in price is extremely short in the case of liquid securities such as common stock. <br /><br />Since all price movements arise from orders placed and executed, prices can respond to news only if there exist individuals in the economy who are alert to the arrival of new information and are willing to adjust positions on this basis. But this raises the question of how such \"information traders\" are able to find willing counterparties. After all, who in their right mind wants to trade with an individual having superior information?<br /><br />This kind of reasoning, when pushed to its logical limits, leads to some paradoxical conclusions. As shown by Aumann, two individuals who are commonly known to be rational, and who share a common prior belief about the likelihood of an event, cannot&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591\">agree to disagree</a>&nbsp;no matter how different their private information might be. That is, they can disagree only if this disagreement is itself not common knowledge. But the willingness of two risk-averse parties to enter opposite sides of a bet <i>requires</i> them to agree to disagree, and hence trade between risk-averse individuals with common priors is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022053182900461\">impossible</a>&nbsp;if they are commonly known to be rational.<br /><br />This may sound like an obscure and irrelevant result, since we see an enormous amount of trading in asset markets, but I find it immensely clarifying. It means that in thinking about trading we have to allow for either departures from (common knowledge of) rationality, or we have to drop the common prior hypothesis. And these two directions lead to different models of trading, with different and testable empirical predictions. <br /><br />The first approach, which maintains the common prior assumption but allows for traders with information-insensitive asset demands, was developed in a hugely influential <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210\">paper</a> by Albert Kyle. Such \"noise traders\" need not be viewed as entirely irrational; they may simply have urgent liquidity needs that require them to enter or exit positions regardless of price. Kyle showed that&nbsp;the presence of such traders induces market makers operating under competitive conditions to post bid and ask prices that could be accepted by any counterparty, including information traders. From this perspective, prices come to reflect information because informed parties trade with uninformed market makers, who compensate for losses on these trades with profits made in transactions with noise traders.<br /><br />An alternative approach, which does not require the presence of noise traders at all but drops the common prior assumption, can be traced to a wonderful (and even earlier)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">paper</a>&nbsp;by Harrison and Kreps. Here all traders have the same information at each point in time, but disagree about its implications for the value of securities. Trade occurs as new information arrives because individuals interpret this information differently. (Formally, they have heterogeneous priors and can therefore disagree even if their posterior beliefs are commonly known.) From this perspective prices respond to news because of heterogeneous <i>interpretations</i> of&nbsp;<i>public</i>&nbsp;information.<br /><br />Since these two approaches imply very different distributions of trading strategies, they are empirically distinguishable in principle. But identifying strategies from a sequence of trades is not an easy task. At a minimum, one needs transaction level data in which each trade is linked to a buyer and seller account, so that the evolution of individual portfolios can be tracked over time. From these portfolio adjustments one might hope to deduce the distribution of strategies in the trading population.<br /><br />In a <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1686004\">paper</a> that I have <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/02/market-ecology.html\">discussed</a> previously on this blog, Kirilenko, Kyle, Samadi and Tuzun have used transaction level data from the S&amp;P 500 E-Mini futures market to partition accounts into a small set of groups, thus mapping out an \"ecosystem'' in which different categories of traders \"occupy quite distinct, albeit overlapping, positions.'' Their concern was primarily with the behavior of high frequency traders both before and during the flash crash of May 6, 2010, especially in relation to liquidity provision. They do not explore the question of how prices come to reflect information, but in principle their data would allow them to do so. <br /><br />I have recently <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2322420\">posted</a>&nbsp;the first draft a paper, written jointly with David Rothschild, that looks at transaction level data from a very different source: Intrade's prediction market for the 2012 US presidential election. Anyone who followed this market over the course of the election cycle will know that prices were highly responsive to information, adjusting almost instantaneously to news. Our main goal in the paper was to map out an ecology of trading strategies and thereby gain some understanding of the process by means of which information comes to be reflected in prices. (We also wanted to evaluate&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">claims</a> made at the time of the election that a large trader was attempting to manipulate prices, but that's a topic for another post.)<br /><br />The data are extremely rich: for each transaction over the two week period immediately preceding the election, we know the price, quantity, time of trade, and aggressor side. Most importantly, we have unique identifiers for the buyer and seller accounts, which allows us to trace the evolution of trader portfolios and profits. No identities can be deduced from this data, but it is possible to make inferences about strategies from the pattern of trades.<br /><br />We focus on contracts referencing the two major party candidates, Obama and Romney. These contracts are structured as binary options, paying $10 if the referenced candidate wins the election and nothing otherwise. The data allows us to compute volume, transactions, aggression, holding duration, directional exposure, margin, and profit for each account. Using this, we are able to group traders into five categories, each associated with a distinct trading strategy. <br /><br />During our observational window there were about 84,000 separate transactions involving 3.5 million contracts and over 3,200 unique accounts. The single largest trader accumulated a net long Romney position of 1.2 million contracts (in part by shorting Obama contracts) and did this by engaging in about 13,000 distinct trades for a total loss in two weeks of about 4 million dollars. But this was not the most frequent trader: a different account was responsible for almost 34,000 transactions, which were clearly implemented algorithmically.<br /><br />One of our most striking findings is that 86% of traders, accounting for 52% of volume, never change the direction of their exposure even once. A further 25% of volume comes from 8% of traders who are strongly biased in one direction or the other. A handful of arbitrageurs account for another 14% of volume, leaving just 6% of accounts and 8% of volume associated with individuals who are unbiased in the sense that they are willing to take directional positions on either side of the market. This suggests to us that information finds its way into prices largely through the activities of traders who are biased in one direction or another, and differ with respect to their interpretations&nbsp;of public&nbsp;information rather than their differential access to private information.<br /><br />Prediction markets have historically generated forecasts that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574072207000807\">compete very effectively</a>&nbsp;with those of the best pollsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if most traders never change the direction of their exposure, how does information come to be reflected in prices? We argue that this occurs through something resembling the following process. Imagine a population of traders partitioned into two groups, one of which is predisposed to believe in an Obama victory while the other is predisposed to believe the opposite. Suppose that the first group has a net long position in the Obama contract while the second is short, and news arrives that suggests a decline in Obama's odds of victory (think of the first debate). Both groups revise their beliefs in response to the new information, but to different degrees. The latter group considers the news to be seriously damaging while the former thinks it isn't quite so bad. Initially both groups wish to sell, so the price drops quickly with very little trade since there are few buyers. But once the price falls far enough, the former group is now willing to buy, thus expanding their long position, while the latter group increases their short exposure. The result is that one group of traders ends up as net buyers of the Obama contract even when the news is bad for the incumbent, while the other ends up increasing short exposure even when the news is good. Prices respond to information, and move in the manner that one would predict, without any individual trader switching direction.<br /><br />This is a very special market, to be sure, more closely related to sports betting than to stock trading. But it does not seem implausible to us that similar patterns of directional exposure may also be found in more traditional and economically important asset markets. Especially in the case of consumer durables, attachment to products and the companies that make them is widespread. It would not be surprising if one were to find Apple or Samsung partisans among investors, just as one finds them among consumers. In this case one would expect to find a set of traders who increase their long positions in Apple even in the face of bad news for the company because they believe that the price has declined more than is warranted by the news. Whether or not such patterns exist is an empirical question that can only be settled with a transaction level analysis of trading data.<br /><br />If there's a message in all this, it is that markets aggregate not just information, but also fundamentally irreconcilable perspectives. Prices, as John Kay <a href=\"http://www.johnkay.com/2011/10/04/the-map-is-not-the-territory-an-essay-on-the-state-of-economics\">puts it</a>, \"are the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world.\" Some of the volatility that one observes in asset markets arises from changes in perspectives, which can happen independently of the arrival of information. This is why substantial \"corrections\" can <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)\">occur</a>&nbsp;even in the absence of significant news, and why stock prices <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1802789\">appear to</a> \"move too much to be justified by subsequent changes in dividends.\" What makes markets appear <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/invincible-markets-hypothesis.html\">invincible</a> is not the perfect aggregation of information that is sometimes attributed to them, but the sheer unpredictability of persuasion, exhortation, and social influence that can give rise to major shifts in the distribution of narratives.&nbsp;</div>" "http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/feeds/3549204192180956705/comments/default" (21055 42887) old 4 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4039434.post-3549204192180956705") (published nil "2013-09-22T14:43:00.000-04:00") (updated nil "2013-09-22T22:29:27.242-04:00") (title ((type .

Markets may <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2327804\">overreact</a> at times but they seldom fail to react at all, and the time lag between the emergence of information and an adjustment in price is extremely short in the case of liquid securities such as common stock. <br /><br />Since all price movements arise from orders placed and executed, prices can respond to news only if there exist individuals in the economy who are alert to the arrival of new information and are willing to adjust positions on this basis. But this raises the question of how such \"information traders\" are able to find willing counterparties. After all, who in their right mind wants to trade with an individual having superior information?<br /><br />This kind of reasoning, when pushed to its logical limits, leads to some paradoxical conclusions. As shown by Aumann, two individuals who are commonly known to be rational, and who share a common prior belief about the likelihood of an event, cannot&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591\">agree to disagree</a>&nbsp;no matter how different their private information might be. That is, they can disagree only if this disagreement is itself not common knowledge. But the willingness of two risk-averse parties to enter opposite sides of a bet <i>requires</i> them to agree to disagree, and hence trade between risk-averse individuals with common priors is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022053182900461\">impossible</a>&nbsp;if they are commonly known to be rational.<br /><br />This may sound like an obscure and irrelevant result, since we see an enormous amount of trading in asset markets, but I find it immensely clarifying. It means that in thinking about trading we have to allow for either departures from (common knowledge of) rationality, or we have to drop the common prior hypothesis. And these two directions lead to different models of trading, with different and testable empirical predictions. <br /><br />The first approach, which maintains the common prior assumption but allows for traders with information-insensitive asset demands, was developed in a hugely influential <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913210\">paper</a> by Albert Kyle. Such \"noise traders\" need not be viewed as entirely irrational; they may simply have urgent liquidity needs that require them to enter or exit positions regardless of price. Kyle showed that&nbsp;the presence of such traders induces market makers operating under competitive conditions to post bid and ask prices that could be accepted by any counterparty, including information traders. From this perspective, prices come to reflect information because informed parties trade with uninformed market makers, who compensate for losses on these trades with profits made in transactions with noise traders.<br /><br />An alternative approach, which does not require the presence of noise traders at all but drops the common prior assumption, can be traced to a wonderful (and even earlier)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">paper</a>&nbsp;by Harrison and Kreps. Here all traders have the same information at each point in time, but disagree about its implications for the value of securities. Trade occurs as new information arrives because individuals interpret this information differently. (Formally, they have heterogeneous priors and can therefore disagree even if their posterior beliefs are commonly known.) From this perspective prices respond to news because of heterogeneous <i>interpretations</i> of&nbsp;<i>public</i>&nbsp;information.<br /><br />Since these two approaches imply very different distributions of trading strategies, they are empirically distinguishable in principle. But identifying strategies from a sequence of trades is not an easy task. At a minimum, one needs transaction level data in which each trade is linked to a buyer and seller account, so that the evolution of individual portfolios can be tracked over time. From these portfolio adjustments one might hope to deduce the distribution of strategies in the trading population.<br /><br />In a <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1686004\">paper</a> that I have <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/02/market-ecology.html\">discussed</a> previously on this blog, Kirilenko, Kyle, Samadi and Tuzun have used transaction level data from the S&amp;P 500 E-Mini futures market to partition accounts into a small set of groups, thus mapping out an \"ecosystem'' in which different categories of traders \"occupy quite distinct, albeit overlapping, positions.'' Their concern was primarily with the behavior of high frequency traders both before and during the flash crash of May 6, 2010, especially in relation to liquidity provision. They do not explore the question of how prices come to reflect information, but in principle their data would allow them to do so. <br /><br />I have recently <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2322420\">posted</a>&nbsp;the first draft a paper, written jointly with David Rothschild, that looks at transaction level data from a very different source: Intrade's prediction market for the 2012 US presidential election. Anyone who followed this market over the course of the election cycle will know that prices were highly responsive to information, adjusting almost instantaneously to news. Our main goal in the paper was to map out an ecology of trading strategies and thereby gain some understanding of the process by means of which information comes to be reflected in prices. (We also wanted to evaluate&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/11/prediction-market-manipulation-case.html\">claims</a> made at the time of the election that a large trader was attempting to manipulate prices, but that's a topic for another post.)<br /><br />The data are extremely rich: for each transaction over the two week period immediately preceding the election, we know the price, quantity, time of trade, and aggressor side. Most importantly, we have unique identifiers for the buyer and seller accounts, which allows us to trace the evolution of trader portfolios and profits. No identities can be deduced from this data, but it is possible to make inferences about strategies from the pattern of trades.<br /><br />We focus on contracts referencing the two major party candidates, Obama and Romney. These contracts are structured as binary options, paying $10 if the referenced candidate wins the election and nothing otherwise. The data allows us to compute volume, transactions, aggression, holding duration, directional exposure, margin, and profit for each account. Using this, we are able to group traders into five categories, each associated with a distinct trading strategy. <br /><br />During our observational window there were about 84,000 separate transactions involving 3.5 million contracts and over 3,200 unique accounts. The single largest trader accumulated a net long Romney position of 1.2 million contracts (in part by shorting Obama contracts) and did this by engaging in about 13,000 distinct trades for a total loss in two weeks of about 4 million dollars. But this was not the most frequent trader: a different account was responsible for almost 34,000 transactions, which were clearly implemented algorithmically.<br /><br />One of our most striking findings is that 86% of traders, accounting for 52% of volume, never change the direction of their exposure even once. A further 25% of volume comes from 8% of traders who are strongly biased in one direction or the other. A handful of arbitrageurs account for another 14% of volume, leaving just 6% of accounts and 8% of volume associated with individuals who are unbiased in the sense that they are willing to take directional positions on either side of the market. This suggests to us that information finds its way into prices largely through the activities of traders who are biased in one direction or another, and differ with respect to their interpretations&nbsp;of public&nbsp;information rather than their differential access to private information.<br /><br />Prediction markets have historically generated forecasts that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574072207000807\">compete very effectively</a>&nbsp;with those of the best pollsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if most traders never change the direction of their exposure, how does information come to be reflected in prices? We argue that this occurs through something resembling the following process. Imagine a population of traders partitioned into two groups, one of which is predisposed to believe in an Obama victory while the other is predisposed to believe the opposite. Suppose that the first group has a net long position in the Obama contract while the second is short, and news arrives that suggests a decline in Obama's odds of victory (think of the first debate). Both groups revise their beliefs in response to the new information, but to different degrees. The latter group considers the news to be seriously damaging while the former thinks it isn't quite so bad. Initially both groups wish to sell, so the price drops quickly with very little trade since there are few buyers. But once the price falls far enough, the former group is now willing to buy, thus expanding their long position, while the latter group increases their short exposure. The result is that one group of traders ends up as net buyers of the Obama contract even when the news is bad for the incumbent, while the other ends up increasing short exposure even when the news is good. Prices respond to information, and move in the manner that one would predict, without any individual trader switching direction.<br /><br />This is a very special market, to be sure, more closely related to sports betting than to stock trading. But it does not seem implausible to us that similar patterns of directional exposure may also be found in more traditional and economically important asset markets. Especially in the case of consumer durables, attachment to products and the companies that make them is widespread. It would not be surprising if one were to find Apple or Samsung partisans among investors, just as one finds them among consumers. In this case one would expect to find a set of traders who increase their long positions in Apple even in the face of bad news for the company because they believe that the price has declined more than is warranted by the news. Whether or not such patterns exist is an empirical question that can only be settled with a transaction level analysis of trading data.<br /><br />If there's a message in all this, it is that markets aggregate not just information, but also fundamentally irreconcilable perspectives. Prices, as John Kay <a href=\"http://www.johnkay.com/2011/10/04/the-map-is-not-the-territory-an-essay-on-the-state-of-economics\">puts it</a>, \"are the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world.\" Some of the volatility that one observes in asset markets arises from changes in perspectives, which can happen independently of the arrival of information. This is why substantial \"corrections\" can <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)\">occur</a>&nbsp;even in the absence of significant news, and why stock prices <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1802789\">appear to</a> \"move too much to be justified by subsequent changes in dividends.\" What makes markets appear <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/invincible-markets-hypothesis.html\">invincible</a> is not the perfect aggregation of information that is sometimes attributed to them, but the sheer unpredictability of persuasion, exhortation, and social influence that can give rise to major shifts in the distribution of narratives.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

It's a tale of a corporation coming down with all its might on a former employee who, when all is said an done, damaged the company only by deciding to take his prodigious talents elsewhere.<br /><br />As is always the case with Lewis, the narrative is brightly lit while the economic insights lie half-concealed in the penumbra of his prose.&nbsp;In this case he manages to shed light on the enormous divergence between the private and social costs of high frequency trading, as well as the madness of an intellectual property regime in which open-source code routinely finds its way into products that are then walled off from the public domain, violating the spirit if not the letter of the original open licenses.<br /><br />Aleynikov was hired by Goldman to help improve its relatively weak position in what is rather euphemistically called the market-making business. In principle, this is the business of offering quotes on both sides of an asset market in order that investors wishing to buy or sell will find willing counterparties. It was once a protected oligopoly in which specialists and dealers made money on substantial spreads between bid and ask prices, in return for which they provided some measure of price continuity.<br /><br />But these spreads have vanished over the past decade or so as the original market makers have been <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-market-makers.html\">displaced</a> by firms using algorithms to implement trading strategies that rely on rapid responses to incoming market data. The strategies are characterized by extremely short holding periods, limited intraday directional exposure, and very high volume. A key point in the transition was the adoption in 2007 of Regulation NMS (National Market System), which required that orders be routed to the exchange offering the best available price. This led to a proliferation of trading venues, since order flow could be attracted by price alone. Lewis describes the transition thus:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For reasons not entirely obvious... the new rule stimulated a huge amount of stock-market trading. Much of the new volume was generated not by old-fashioned investors but by extremely fast computers controlled by high-frequency-trading firms... Essentially, the more places there were to trade stocks, the greater the opportunity there was for high-frequency traders to interpose themselves between buyers on one exchange and sellers on another. This was perverse. The initial promise of computer technology was to remove the intermediary from the financial market, or at least reduce the amount he could scalp from that market. The reality has turned out to be a boom in financial intermediation and an estimated take for Wall Street of somewhere between $10 and $20 billion a year, depending on whose estimates you wish to believe. As high-frequency-trading firms aren’t required to disclose their profits... no one really knows just how much money is being made. But when a single high-frequency trader is paid $75 million in cash for a single year of trading (as was Misha Malyshev in 2008, when he worked at Citadel) and then quits because he is “dissatisfied,” a new beast is afoot.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The combination of new market rules and new technology was turning the stock market into, in effect, a war of robots. The robots were absurdly fast: they could execute tens of thousands of stock-market transactions in the time it took a human trader to blink his eye. The games they played were often complicated, but one aspect of them was simple and clear: the faster the robot, the more likely it was to make money at the expense of the relative sloth of others in the market.</blockquote>This last point is not quite right: speed alone can't get you very far unless you have an effective trading strategy. Knight Capital <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/928a1528-1859-11e2-80e9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2auUtXYXx\">managed to lose</a> almost a half billion dollars in less than an hour not because their algorithms were slow but because they did not faithfully execute the intended strategy. But what makes a strategy effective? The key, as Andrei Kirilenko and his co-authors discovered in their <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1686004\">study</a> of transaction-level data from the S&amp;P E-mini futures market, is predictive power<i>:</i><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">High Frequency Traders effectively predict and react to price changes... [they] are consistently profitable although they never accumulate a large net position...&nbsp;HFTs appear to trade in the same direction as the contemporaneous price and prices of the past five seconds. In other words, they buy... if the immediate prices are rising. However, after about ten seconds, they appear to reverse the direction of their trading... possibly due to their speed advantage or superior ability to predict price changes, HFTs are able to buy right as the prices are about to increase... They do not hold positions over long periods of time and revert to their target inventory level quickly... HFTs very quickly reduce their inventories by submitting marketable orders. They also aggressively trade when prices are about to change.&nbsp;</blockquote>Aleynikov was hired to speed up Goldman's systems, but he was largely unaware of (and seemed genuinely uninterested in) the details of their trading strategies. Here's Lewis again:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Oddly, he found his job more interesting than the stock-market trading he was enabling. “I think the engineering problems are much more interesting than the business problems,” he says... He understood that Goldman’s quants were forever dreaming up new trading strategies, in the form of algorithms, for the robots to execute, and that these traders were meant to be extremely shrewd. He grasped further that “all their algorithms are premised on some sort of prediction—predicting something one second into the future.”</blockquote>Effective prediction of price movements, even over such very short horizons, is not an easy task. It is essentially a problem of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/blame-instructions-not-machines.html\">information extraction</a>, based on rapid processing of incoming market data. The important point is that this information would have found its way into prices sooner or later in any case. By anticipating the process by a fraction of a second, the new market makers are able to generate a great deal of private value. But they are not responsible for the informational content of prices, and their profits, as well as the substantial cost of their operations, therefore must come at the expense of those investors who are actually trading on fundamental information.<br /><br />It is commonly argued that high frequency trading benefits institutional and retail investors because it has resulted in a sharp decline in bid-ask spreads. But this spread is a highly imperfect measure of the value to investors of the change in regime. What matters, especially for institutional investors placing large orders based on fundamental research, is not the marginal price at which the first few shares trade but the average price over the entire transaction. And if their private information is effectively extracted early in this process, the price impact of their activity will be greater, and price volatility will be higher in general.<br /><br />After all, it was a large order from an institutional investor <span id=\"goog_2107608598\"></span><span id=\"goog_2107608599\"></span><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\"></a>in the S&amp;P futures market that triggered the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8ee1a816-cd81-11df-9c82-00144feab49a.html#axzz2auUtXYXx\">flash crash</a>, sending indexes plummeting briefly, and individual securities trading at absurd prices. Accenture traded for a penny on the way down, and Sotheby's for a hundred thousand dollars a share on the bounce back.<br /><br />In evaluating the impact on investors of the change in market microstructure, it is worth keeping in mind&nbsp;<a href=\"http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/WSJ_2-07.pdf\">Bogle's Law</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It is the iron law of the markets, the undefiable rules of arithmetic: Gross return in the market, less the costs of financial intermediation, equals the net return actually delivered to market participants.</blockquote>This is just basic accounting, but often overlooked. If one wants to argue that the new organization of markets has been beneficial to investors, one needs to make the case that the costs of financial intermediation in the aggregate have gone down. Smaller bid-ask spreads have to be balanced against the massive increase in volume, the profits of the new market makers, and most importantly, the costs of high-frequency trading. These include nontrivial payments to highly skilled programmers and quants, as well as the costs of infrastructure, equipment, and energy. Lewis notes that&nbsp;the \"top high-frequency-trading firms chuck out their old gear and buy new stuff every few months,\" but these costs probably pale in comparison with those of cables facilitating&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-the-speed-of-light-is-too-slow\">rapid transmission</a>&nbsp;across large distances and the more mundane costs of cooling systems. All told, it is far from clear that the costs of financial intermediation have fallen in the aggregate.<br /><br />This post is already too long, but I'd like to briefly mention a quite different point that emerges from the Lewis article since it relates to a theme&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-intellectual-property-and-guard.html\">previously explored</a> on this blog. Aleynikov relied routinely on open-source code, which he modified and improved to meet the needs of the company. It is customary, if not mandatory, for these improvements to be released back into the public domain for use by others. But his attempts to do so were blocked:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Serge quickly discovered, to his surprise, that Goldman had a one-way relationship with open source. They took huge amounts of free software off the Web, but they did not return it after he had modified it, even when his modifications were very slight and of general rather than financial use. “Once I took some open-source components, repackaged them to come up with a component that was not even used at Goldman Sachs,” he says. “It was basically a way to make two computers look like one, so if one went down the other could jump in and perform the task.” He described the pleasure of his innovation this way: “It created something out of chaos. When you create something out of chaos, essentially, you reduce the entropy in the world.” He went to his boss, a fellow named Adam Schlesinger, and asked if he could release it back into open source, as was his inclination. “He said it was now Goldman’s property,” recalls Serge. “He was quite tense. When I mentioned it, it was very close to bonus time. And he didn’t want any disturbances.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Open source was an idea that depended on collaboration and sharing, and Serge had a long history of contributing to it. He didn’t fully understand how Goldman could think it was O.K. to benefit so greatly from the work of others and then behave so selfishly toward them... But from then on, on instructions from Schlesinger, he treated everything on Goldman Sachs’s servers, even if it had just been transferred there from open source, as Goldman Sachs’s property. (At Serge’s trial Kevin Marino, his lawyer, flashed two pages of computer code: the original, with its open-source license on top, and a replica, with the open-source license stripped off and replaced by the Goldman Sachs license.)</blockquote>This unwillingness to refresh the reservoir of ideas from which one drinks may be good for the firm but is clearly bad for the economy. As Michele Boldin and David Levine have strenuously <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=vdBtQgAACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">argued</a>, the rate of innovation in the software industry was dramatic prior to 1981 (before which software could not be patented):<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">What about the graphical user interfaces, the widgets such as buttons and icons, the compilers, assemblers, linked lists, object oriented programs, databases, search algorithms, font displays, word processing, computer languages – all the vast array of algorithms and methods that go into even the simplest modern program? ... Each and every one of these key innovations occurred prior to 1981 and so occurred without the benefit of patent protection. Not only that, had all these bits and pieces of computer programs been patented, as they certainly would have in the current regime, far from being enhanced, progress in the software industry would never have taken place. According to Bill Gates – hardly your radical communist or utopist – “If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today.”</blockquote>Vigorous innovation in open source development continues under the current system, but relies on a willingness to give back on the part of those who benefit from it, even if they are not legally mandated to do so. Aleynikov's natural instincts to reciprocate were blocked by his employer for reasons that are easy to understand but very difficult to sympathize with.<br /><br />Lewis concludes his piece by reflecting on Goldman's motives:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The real mystery, to the insiders, wasn’t why Serge had done what he had done. It was why Goldman Sachs had done what it had done. Why on earth call the F.B.I.? Why coach your employees to say what they need to say on a witness stand to maximize the possibility of sending him to prison? Why exploit the ignorance of both the general public and the legal system about complex financial matters to punish this one little guy? Why must the spider always eat the fly?</blockquote>The answer to this, I think, is contained in the company's response to Lewis, which is now appended to the article. The statement is impersonal, stern, vague and legalistic. It quotes an appeals court that overturned the verdict in a manner that suggests support for Goldman's position. Like the actions of the proverbial spider, it's a reflex, unconstrained by reflection or self-examination. Even if the management's primary fiduciary duty is to protect the interests of shareholders, this really does seem like a very shortsighted way to proceed.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br /><b>Update (August 6)</b>.

Essentially, the more places there were to trade stocks, the greater the opportunity there was for high-frequency traders to interpose themselves between buyers on one exchange and sellers on another. This was perverse. The initial promise of computer technology was to remove the intermediary from the financial market, or at least reduce the amount he could scalp from that market. The reality has turned out to be a boom in financial intermediation and an estimated take for Wall Street of somewhere between $10 and $20 billion a year, depending on whose estimates you wish to believe. As high-frequency-trading firms aren’t required to disclose their profits... no one really knows just how much money is being made. But when a single high-frequency trader is paid $75 million in cash for a single year of trading (as was Misha Malyshev in 2008, when he worked at Citadel) and then quits because he is “dissatisfied,” a new beast is afoot.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The combination of new market rules and new technology was turning the stock market into, in effect, a war of robots. The robots were absurdly fast: they could execute tens of thousands of stock-market transactions in the time it took a human trader to blink his eye. The games they played were often complicated, but one aspect of them was simple and clear: the faster the robot, the more likely it was to make money at the expense of the relative sloth of others in the market.</blockquote>This last point is not quite right: speed alone can't get you very far unless you have an effective trading strategy. Knight Capital <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/928a1528-1859-11e2-80e9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2auUtXYXx\">managed to lose</a> almost a half billion dollars in less than an hour not because their algorithms were slow but because they did not faithfully execute the intended strategy. But what makes a strategy effective? The key, as Andrei Kirilenko and his co-authors discovered in their <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1686004\">study</a> of transaction-level data from the S&amp;P E-mini futures market, is predictive power<i>:</i><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">High Frequency Traders effectively predict and react to price changes... [they] are consistently profitable although they never accumulate a large net position...&nbsp;HFTs appear to trade in the same direction as the contemporaneous price and prices of the past five seconds. In other words, they buy... if the immediate prices are rising. However, after about ten seconds, they appear to reverse the direction of their trading... possibly due to their speed advantage or superior ability to predict price changes, HFTs are able to buy right as the prices are about to increase... They do not hold positions over long periods of time and revert to their target inventory level quickly... HFTs very quickly reduce their inventories by submitting marketable orders. They also aggressively trade when prices are about to change.&nbsp;</blockquote>Aleynikov was hired to speed up Goldman's systems, but he was largely unaware of (and seemed genuinely uninterested in) the details of their trading strategies. Here's Lewis again:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Oddly, he found his job more interesting than the stock-market trading he was enabling. “I think the engineering problems are much more interesting than the business problems,” he says... He understood that Goldman’s quants were forever dreaming up new trading strategies, in the form of algorithms, for the robots to execute, and that these traders were meant to be extremely shrewd. He grasped further that “all their algorithms are premised on some sort of prediction—predicting something one second into the future.”</blockquote>Effective prediction of price movements, even over such very short horizons, is not an easy task. It is essentially a problem of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/blame-instructions-not-machines.html\">information extraction</a>, based on rapid processing of incoming market data. The important point is that this information would have found its way into prices sooner or later in any case. By anticipating the process by a fraction of a second, the new market makers are able to generate a great deal of private value. But they are not responsible for the informational content of prices, and their profits, as well as the substantial cost of their operations, therefore must come at the expense of those investors who are actually trading on fundamental information.<br /><br />It is commonly argued that high frequency trading benefits institutional and retail investors because it has resulted in a sharp decline in bid-ask spreads. But this spread is a highly imperfect measure of the value to investors of the change in regime. What matters, especially for institutional investors placing large orders based on fundamental research, is not the marginal price at which the first few shares trade but the average price over the entire transaction. And if their private information is effectively extracted early in this process, the price impact of their activity will be greater, and price volatility will be higher in general.<br /><br />After all, it was a large order from an institutional investor <span id=\"goog_2107608598\"></span><span id=\"goog_2107608599\"></span><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\"></a>in the S&amp;P futures market that triggered the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8ee1a816-cd81-11df-9c82-00144feab49a.html#axzz2auUtXYXx\">flash crash</a>, sending indexes plummeting briefly, and individual securities trading at absurd prices. Accenture traded for a penny on the way down, and Sotheby's for a hundred thousand dollars a share on the bounce back.<br /><br />In evaluating the impact on investors of the change in market microstructure, it is worth keeping in mind&nbsp;<a href=\"http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/WSJ_2-07.pdf\">Bogle's Law</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It is the iron law of the markets, the undefiable rules of arithmetic: Gross return in the market, less the costs of financial intermediation, equals the net return actually delivered to market participants.</blockquote>This is just basic accounting, but often overlooked. If one wants to argue that the new organization of markets has been beneficial to investors, one needs to make the case that the costs of financial intermediation in the aggregate have gone down. Smaller bid-ask spreads have to be balanced against the massive increase in volume, the profits of the new market makers, and most importantly, the costs of high-frequency trading. These include nontrivial payments to highly skilled programmers and quants, as well as the costs of infrastructure, equipment, and energy. Lewis notes that&nbsp;the \"top high-frequency-trading firms chuck out their old gear and buy new stuff every few months,\" but these costs probably pale in comparison with those of cables facilitating&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-the-speed-of-light-is-too-slow\">rapid transmission</a>&nbsp;across large distances and the more mundane costs of cooling systems. All told, it is far from clear that the costs of financial intermediation have fallen in the aggregate.<br /><br />This post is already too long, but I'd like to briefly mention a quite different point that emerges from the Lewis article since it relates to a theme&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-intellectual-property-and-guard.html\">previously explored</a> on this blog. Aleynikov relied routinely on open-source code, which he modified and improved to meet the needs of the company. It is customary, if not mandatory, for these improvements to be released back into the public domain for use by others. But his attempts to do so were blocked:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Serge quickly discovered, to his surprise, that Goldman had a one-way relationship with open source. They took huge amounts of free software off the Web, but they did not return it after he had modified it, even when his modifications were very slight and of general rather than financial use. “Once I took some open-source components, repackaged them to come up with a component that was not even used at Goldman Sachs,” he says. “It was basically a way to make two computers look like one, so if one went down the other could jump in and perform the task.” He described the pleasure of his innovation this way: “It created something out of chaos. When you create something out of chaos, essentially, you reduce the entropy in the world.” He went to his boss, a fellow named Adam Schlesinger, and asked if he could release it back into open source, as was his inclination. “He said it was now Goldman’s property,” recalls Serge. “He was quite tense. When I mentioned it, it was very close to bonus time. And he didn’t want any disturbances.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Open source was an idea that depended on collaboration and sharing, and Serge had a long history of contributing to it. He didn’t fully understand how Goldman could think it was O.K. to benefit so greatly from the work of others and then behave so selfishly toward them... But from then on, on instructions from Schlesinger, he treated everything on Goldman Sachs’s servers, even if it had just been transferred there from open source, as Goldman Sachs’s property. (At Serge’s trial Kevin Marino, his lawyer, flashed two pages of computer code: the original, with its open-source license on top, and a replica, with the open-source license stripped off and replaced by the Goldman Sachs license.)</blockquote>This unwillingness to refresh the reservoir of ideas from which one drinks may be good for the firm but is clearly bad for the economy. As Michele Boldin and David Levine have strenuously <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=vdBtQgAACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">argued</a>, the rate of innovation in the software industry was dramatic prior to 1981 (before which software could not be patented):<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">What about the graphical user interfaces, the widgets such as buttons and icons, the compilers, assemblers, linked lists, object oriented programs, databases, search algorithms, font displays, word processing, computer languages – all the vast array of algorithms and methods that go into even the simplest modern program? ... Each and every one of these key innovations occurred prior to 1981 and so occurred without the benefit of patent protection. Not only that, had all these bits and pieces of computer programs been patented, as they certainly would have in the current regime, far from being enhanced, progress in the software industry would never have taken place. According to Bill Gates – hardly your radical communist or utopist – “If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today.”</blockquote>Vigorous innovation in open source development continues under the current system, but relies on a willingness to give back on the part of those who benefit from it, even if they are not legally mandated to do so. Aleynikov's natural instincts to reciprocate were blocked by his employer for reasons that are easy to understand but very difficult to sympathize with.<br /><br />Lewis concludes his piece by reflecting on Goldman's motives:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The real mystery, to the insiders, wasn’t why Serge had done what he had done. It was why Goldman Sachs had done what it had done. Why on earth call the F.B.I.? Why coach your employees to say what they need to say on a witness stand to maximize the possibility of sending him to prison? Why exploit the ignorance of both the general public and the legal system about complex financial matters to punish this one little guy? Why must the spider always eat the fly?</blockquote>The answer to this, I think, is contained in the company's response to Lewis, which is now appended to the article. The statement is impersonal, stern, vague and legalistic. It quotes an appeals court that overturned the verdict in a manner that suggests support for Goldman's position. Like the actions of the proverbial spider, it's a reflex, unconstrained by reflection or self-examination. Even if the management's primary fiduciary duty is to protect the interests of shareholders, this really does seem like a very shortsighted way to proceed.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br /><b>Update (August 6)</b>.

This simple experiment, amazingly enough, sheds light on some fundamental questions in monetary economics, helps explain why conventional monetary policy via asset purchases has recently been so ineffective in stimulating the economy, suggests alternative approaches that might be substantially more effective, and speaks to the feasibility of the Chicago Plan (originally advanced by Henry Simons and Irving Fisher, and recently <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12202.pdf\">endorsed</a> by a couple of IMF economists) to abolish privately issued money. <br /><br />So what exactly was the Macon Money project? It began with a grant of $65,000 by the Knight Foundation, which was used to back the issue of bonds. These bonds were (literally) sliced in two and the halves were given away through various channels to residents of Macon. If a pair of individuals holding halves of the same bond could find each other, they were able to exchange the (now complete) bond for Macon Money, which could then be used to make expenditures at a variety of local businesses. These business were happy to accept Macon Money because it could be redeemed at par for US currency.<br /><br />The basic idea is described here:<br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"253\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/OT91aQTFHiY?rel=0\" width=\"450\"></iframe> </div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>The demographics of the participant population, the distribution of expenditures, and the strategies used by players to find their \"other halves\" are all described in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/macon-money-game-evaluation-summary/\">evaluation summary</a>.&nbsp;The project had the twin goals of building social capital and stimulating economic development. Although few enduring ties were created among the players, participation did create a sense of excitement about Macon and greater optimism about its future. And participating businesses managed to find a new pool of repeat customers.<br /><br />Macon money was a fiscal intervention (an injection of funds into the locality) accomplished using the device of privately issued money convertible at par. There was a temporary increase in the local money supply which was extinguished when businesses redeemed their notes. An interesting thought experiment is to imagine what would have happened if, instead of being convertible at par, businesses could only convert Macon Money into currency at a small discount.<br /><br />Businesses that accept credit card payments are exactly in this situation, facing a haircut of 1-3 percent when they convert credit card payments into cash. Most businesses that participated in the original experiment would therefore likely continue to participate in the modified one. After all, businesses involved in Groupon campaigns accept a 75% haircut once Groupon takes its share of the discounted price.<br /><br />But there is one critically important difference between Macon Money and a credit card payment: the former is <i>negotiable</i> while the latter is not. That is, instead of being redeemed at a small discount, Macon Money could be spent at par. If enough businesses were participating, it would make sense for each one to spend rather than redeem its receipts. The privately issued money would therefore remain in circulation.<br /><br />What about a business that had no interest in spending its receipts on locally provided goods and services? Even in this case, there would be better alternatives to redeeming at a discount. For instance, if the discount were 3%, there would be room for the emergence of a local intermediary who offered cash at a more attractive 2% discount to the business, and then sold Macon Money at 1% below par to those who did wish to spend locally. Again, the privately issued money would remain in circulation.<br /><br />As a result, the local money supply would have grown not just for a brief period, but indefinitely. The discount itself would allow for more money to be injected for any given amount of backing funds. And as long as convertibility was never in doubt, substantially more money could be issued than the funds earmarked to back it.<br /><br />This simple thought experiment tells us something about policy. Macon Money provided an injection of liquidity that improved the balance sheets of those who managed to secure bonds. This allowed for an increase in aggregate expenditure, and given the slack in local productive capacity, also an increase in production.<br /><br />It was expansionary monetary policy, but quite different from the kind of policy pursued by the Federal Reserve. The Fed expands the money supply by buying securities, which leads to a change in the composition of the asset side of individual balance sheets. Higher asset prices (and correspondingly lower interest rates) are supposed to stimulate demand through increased borrowing at more attractive rates. But in a balance sheet recession, distressed borrowers are unwilling to take on more debt and the stimulative effects of such a policy are accordingly <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/06/fighting-over-claims.html\">muted</a>. This is why calls for an <a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/918.html\">alternative</a> <a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/\">approach</a> to monetary policy make analytical sense.<br /><br />Furthermore, the fact that Macon Money was accepted only locally meant that it could not be used for imports from other locations. The monetary stimulus was therefore not subject to the kinds of demand leakages that would arise from the issue of generalized fiat money.<br /><br />Finally, the project provided a very clear illustration of the difficulty of <a href=\"http://slackwire.blogspot.com/2012/11/imf-abolish-debt.html\">abolishing</a>&nbsp;privately issued money. Unless one were to prevent all creditworthy institutions from issuing convertible liabilities, it would be virtually impossible to halt the use of such liabilities as media of exchange. Put differently, we are always going to have a shadow banking system. But what the Macon Money initiative shows is that the creative and judicious use of private money, backed by creditworthy foundations, can revitalize communities currently operating well below their productive potential. Whether this can be done in a scalable way, with some government involvement and oversight to prevent abuse, remains unclear. But surely the idea deserves a closer look?<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br />Update. Another important feature of Macon Money is the fact that it cannot be used to pay down debt unless the creditors are themselves local. This means that even highly indebted households will either spend it, or pay down debt by selling their notes to someone who will. If increasing economic activity is the goal, this is vastly superior to disbursements of cash.<br /><br />Joseph Cotterill <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/04/25/1476452/the-closer-226/\">asks</a> (rhetorically) whether Macon Money is the anti-Bitcoin. Exactly right, and very well put.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br /><a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/\">Ashwin Parameswaran</a>&nbsp;has sent in the following via email (posted with permission):<br /><blockquote>Just read your post on Macon money - fascinating experiment and your thought experiment on how it could stay in circulation was equally interesting. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>On the thought experiment, there's also a possibility that if Macon money can only be converted into currency at a discount then Macon money itself would be valued at a discount. Coming back to your example on credit cards, this often happens in countries where retailers can get away with it. Lots of small retailers in India offer cash discounts even when they give you a receipt i.e. its not just a tax dodge. Many retailers in the UK simply don't accept Amex cards because of the size of the haircut they impose. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>On the broader subject of imagining various types of money, this is probably closest to private banking money whereas Bitcoin is by design closest to gold. Another experiment is the idea of pure local credit money without even the intermediation of a private bank-like entity which seems to be the idea behind <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_monetary_system\">Ripple</a> although the current implementation seems to be a little different. Over the last year I've done a lot of reading on 14th-17th century English history of credit/money and its almost universally accepted that most of the local money worked largely with such peer-to-peer credit systems with gold perennially being in short supply. The section of <a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/10/17/monetary-and-fiscal-economics-for-a-near-credit-economy/\">this post</a> titled 'Interest-Bearing Money: Debt as Money' summarises some of my reading. The first half of Carl Wennerlind’s book ‘Casualties of Credit’ is excellent and has some great references in this area.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>You could see the entire arc of the last 400 years as an exercise in making these private webs of credit more stable. So peer-to-peer credit became private banking. Then comes the lender of last resort and fiat money so that the LOLR is not constrained. At the same time we make the collateral safer and safer - govt bonds during the English Financial revolution, now MBS, bank debt etc. The irony is that now banks finance everything except what they started out financing which is SME bills of exchange/invoices. Partly the reasons are regulatory but fundamentally the risk is too idiosyncratic and \"micro\" in an environment where macro risks are backstopped.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>In fact here in the UK there's a lot of non-bank and even peer to peer interest in some of these spaces. See <a href=\"http://marketinvoice.com/\">this one</a> for invoice financing (the interest is partly because peer-to-peer lending in the UK has almost no regulatory burden, not regulated by the FSA at all). In a way this is just a modern-day reconstruction of the same system that existed in 16th-17th century England - peer-to-peer webs of credit. But with the critical difference that the system is not as elastic and doesn't really need to be. There are enough individuals, insurers etc who are more than capable of taking on the real risk and giving up their own purchasing power in the interim period for an adequate return.&nbsp;</blockquote>Lots to think about here. Briefly, on the issue of Macon Money being valued at a discount, this seems unlikely to me except in a secondary market for conversion into cash. Unlike credit card receipts, Macon Money is negotiable, and as long as it can be converted into goods and services at par it will be valued at par by those who plan to spend it. Of course there may be an equilibrium in which vendors themselves only accept it at a discount, which then becomes a self-sustaining practice. This would be equivalent to a selective increase in price, possible only if there is insufficient competition.<br /><br />Here's more from Ashwin:<br /><blockquote>Another tangential point on the peer-to-peer credit networks in 16th century England was that although they had the downside of being perpetually fragile (there are accounts of middle-class traders feeling permanently insecure because they were always entrenched in long webs of credit), this credit money could not be hoarded by anyone. In this sense it really was the anti-gold/bitcoin. I wonder what you would need to do to Macon Money to protect against the potential leakage of being just hoarded as a store of value. This is of course what people like Silvio Gesell were concerned with (there are some excellent comments by anonymous commenter 'K' on <a href=\"http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/02/money-as-store-of-wealth.html\">this Nick Rowe post</a> on the paradox of hoarding). I think there's merit to a modern money that could be a medium of exchange but could not serve as a store of wealth. I often think about what such a money could look like but at the end of the day we really need experiments and trials to figure out what could work.&nbsp;</blockquote>Agreed. </div>" "http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/feeds/730883333706394288/comments/default" (20868 1037) old 6 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4039434.post-730883333706394288") (published nil "2013-04-25T14:24:00.000-04:00") (updated nil "2013-05-03T14:38:05.919-04:00") (title ((type .

Although few enduring ties were created among the players, participation did create a sense of excitement about Macon and greater optimism about its future. And participating businesses managed to find a new pool of repeat customers.<br /><br />Macon money was a fiscal intervention (an injection of funds into the locality) accomplished using the device of privately issued money convertible at par. There was a temporary increase in the local money supply which was extinguished when businesses redeemed their notes. An interesting thought experiment is to imagine what would have happened if, instead of being convertible at par, businesses could only convert Macon Money into currency at a small discount.<br /><br />Businesses that accept credit card payments are exactly in this situation, facing a haircut of 1-3 percent when they convert credit card payments into cash. Most businesses that participated in the original experiment would therefore likely continue to participate in the modified one. After all, businesses involved in Groupon campaigns accept a 75% haircut once Groupon takes its share of the discounted price.<br /><br />But there is one critically important difference between Macon Money and a credit card payment: the former is <i>negotiable</i> while the latter is not. That is, instead of being redeemed at a small discount, Macon Money could be spent at par. If enough businesses were participating, it would make sense for each one to spend rather than redeem its receipts. The privately issued money would therefore remain in circulation.<br /><br />What about a business that had no interest in spending its receipts on locally provided goods and services? Even in this case, there would be better alternatives to redeeming at a discount. For instance, if the discount were 3%, there would be room for the emergence of a local intermediary who offered cash at a more attractive 2% discount to the business, and then sold Macon Money at 1% below par to those who did wish to spend locally. Again, the privately issued money would remain in circulation.<br /><br />As a result, the local money supply would have grown not just for a brief period, but indefinitely. The discount itself would allow for more money to be injected for any given amount of backing funds. And as long as convertibility was never in doubt, substantially more money could be issued than the funds earmarked to back it.<br /><br />This simple thought experiment tells us something about policy. Macon Money provided an injection of liquidity that improved the balance sheets of those who managed to secure bonds. This allowed for an increase in aggregate expenditure, and given the slack in local productive capacity, also an increase in production.<br /><br />It was expansionary monetary policy, but quite different from the kind of policy pursued by the Federal Reserve. The Fed expands the money supply by buying securities, which leads to a change in the composition of the asset side of individual balance sheets. Higher asset prices (and correspondingly lower interest rates) are supposed to stimulate demand through increased borrowing at more attractive rates. But in a balance sheet recession, distressed borrowers are unwilling to take on more debt and the stimulative effects of such a policy are accordingly <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/06/fighting-over-claims.html\">muted</a>. This is why calls for an <a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/918.html\">alternative</a> <a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/\">approach</a> to monetary policy make analytical sense.<br /><br />Furthermore, the fact that Macon Money was accepted only locally meant that it could not be used for imports from other locations. The monetary stimulus was therefore not subject to the kinds of demand leakages that would arise from the issue of generalized fiat money.<br /><br />Finally, the project provided a very clear illustration of the difficulty of <a href=\"http://slackwire.blogspot.com/2012/11/imf-abolish-debt.html\">abolishing</a>&nbsp;privately issued money. Unless one were to prevent all creditworthy institutions from issuing convertible liabilities, it would be virtually impossible to halt the use of such liabilities as media of exchange. Put differently, we are always going to have a shadow banking system. But what the Macon Money initiative shows is that the creative and judicious use of private money, backed by creditworthy foundations, can revitalize communities currently operating well below their productive potential. Whether this can be done in a scalable way, with some government involvement and oversight to prevent abuse, remains unclear. But surely the idea deserves a closer look?<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br />Update. Another important feature of Macon Money is the fact that it cannot be used to pay down debt unless the creditors are themselves local. This means that even highly indebted households will either spend it, or pay down debt by selling their notes to someone who will. If increasing economic activity is the goal, this is vastly superior to disbursements of cash.<br /><br />Joseph Cotterill <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/04/25/1476452/the-closer-226/\">asks</a> (rhetorically) whether Macon Money is the anti-Bitcoin. Exactly right, and very well put.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">---</div><br /><a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/\">Ashwin Parameswaran</a>&nbsp;has sent in the following via email (posted with permission):<br /><blockquote>Just read your post on Macon money - fascinating experiment and your thought experiment on how it could stay in circulation was equally interesting. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>On the thought experiment, there's also a possibility that if Macon money can only be converted into currency at a discount then Macon money itself would be valued at a discount. Coming back to your example on credit cards, this often happens in countries where retailers can get away with it. Lots of small retailers in India offer cash discounts even when they give you a receipt i.e. its not just a tax dodge. Many retailers in the UK simply don't accept Amex cards because of the size of the haircut they impose. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>On the broader subject of imagining various types of money, this is probably closest to private banking money whereas Bitcoin is by design closest to gold. Another experiment is the idea of pure local credit money without even the intermediation of a private bank-like entity which seems to be the idea behind <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_monetary_system\">Ripple</a> although the current implementation seems to be a little different. Over the last year I've done a lot of reading on 14th-17th century English history of credit/money and its almost universally accepted that most of the local money worked largely with such peer-to-peer credit systems with gold perennially being in short supply. The section of <a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/10/17/monetary-and-fiscal-economics-for-a-near-credit-economy/\">this post</a> titled 'Interest-Bearing Money: Debt as Money' summarises some of my reading. The first half of Carl Wennerlind’s book ‘Casualties of Credit’ is excellent and has some great references in this area.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>You could see the entire arc of the last 400 years as an exercise in making these private webs of credit more stable. So peer-to-peer credit became private banking. Then comes the lender of last resort and fiat money so that the LOLR is not constrained. At the same time we make the collateral safer and safer - govt bonds during the English Financial revolution, now MBS, bank debt etc. The irony is that now banks finance everything except what they started out financing which is SME bills of exchange/invoices. Partly the reasons are regulatory but fundamentally the risk is too idiosyncratic and \"micro\" in an environment where macro risks are backstopped.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>In fact here in the UK there's a lot of non-bank and even peer to peer interest in some of these spaces. See <a href=\"http://marketinvoice.com/\">this one</a> for invoice financing (the interest is partly because peer-to-peer lending in the UK has almost no regulatory burden, not regulated by the FSA at all). In a way this is just a modern-day reconstruction of the same system that existed in 16th-17th century England - peer-to-peer webs of credit. But with the critical difference that the system is not as elastic and doesn't really need to be. There are enough individuals, insurers etc who are more than capable of taking on the real risk and giving up their own purchasing power in the interim period for an adequate return.&nbsp;</blockquote>Lots to think about here. Briefly, on the issue of Macon Money being valued at a discount, this seems unlikely to me except in a secondary market for conversion into cash. Unlike credit card receipts, Macon Money is negotiable, and as long as it can be converted into goods and services at par it will be valued at par by those who plan to spend it. Of course there may be an equilibrium in which vendors themselves only accept it at a discount, which then becomes a self-sustaining practice. This would be equivalent to a selective increase in price, possible only if there is insufficient competition.<br /><br />Here's more from Ashwin:<br /><blockquote>Another tangential point on the peer-to-peer credit networks in 16th century England was that although they had the downside of being perpetually fragile (there are accounts of middle-class traders feeling permanently insecure because they were always entrenched in long webs of credit), this credit money could not be hoarded by anyone. In this sense it really was the anti-gold/bitcoin. I wonder what you would need to do to Macon Money to protect against the potential leakage of being just hoarded as a store of value. This is of course what people like Silvio Gesell were concerned with (there are some excellent comments by anonymous commenter 'K' on <a href=\"http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/02/money-as-store-of-wealth.html\">this Nick Rowe post</a> on the paradox of hoarding). I think there's merit to a modern money that could be a medium of exchange but could not serve as a store of wealth. I often think about what such a money could look like but at the end of the day we really need experiments and trials to figure out what could work.&nbsp;</blockquote>Agreed. </div>") (link ((rel .

I met him in person just once, though I was fortunate enough to get to know Sarah a little during my year at the Institute.<br /><br />Since my connection to Albert was largely through his writing, I’d like to speak about his love of language, his gift for expression, and his approach to the written word. To Albert, words were not merely vehicles for the transmission of ideas—they were objects to be played with and molded into structures in which one could perpetually take delight.<br /><br />In 1993 Albert gave an interview to a group of Italian writers, which he later translated into English and published under the title <i>Crossing Boundaries</i>. I’d like to quote a segment of that interview that sums up very nicely both his playful relationship with language and the great originality of his ideas. This is what he said:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">I enjoy playing with words, inventing new expressions. I believe there is much more wisdom in words than we normally assume.... Here is an example. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">One of my recent antagonists, Mancur Olson, uses the expression \"logic of collective action\" in order to demonstrate the illogic of collective action, that is, the virtual unlikelihood that collective action can ever happen. At some point I was thinking about the fundamental rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence and that beautiful expression of American freedom as \"the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"I noted how, in addition to the pursuit of happiness, one might also underline the importance of the <i>happiness of pursuit</i>, which is precisely the felicity of taking part in collective action. I simply was happy when that play on words occurred to me.</blockquote>This idea of the <i>happiness of pursuit</i>, the pleasure that one takes in collective action, was to be a central theme in his masterpiece <i>Exit, Voice and Loyalty</i>, published in 1970. Two centuries earlier, Adam Smith had spoken of our propensity to \"truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.\" Albert Hirschman spoke instead of a propensity to protest, complain, and generally \"kick up a fuss.\" This articulation of discontent he called <i>Voice</i>.<br /><br />Albert believed that voice was an important factor in arresting and reversing decline in firms, organizations, and states. Economists to that point had focused on a very different mechanism, namely desertion or <i>exit</i>, and had argued that greater competition, in the form of greater ease of exit, was a beneficial force in maintaining high levels of organizational performance.<br /><br />Albert pointed out that there was a trade-off between exit and voice; that greater ease of exit could result in a stifling of voice as the individuals most inclined to protest and complain chose to depart instead. He also observed that <i>loyalty</i>, provided that it was not completely blind and uncritical, could serve to delay exit and thus create the space for voice to do its work.<br /><br />What Albert did in <i>Exit, Voice and Loyalty</i> was nothing less than to reunite two disciplines, economics and political science, which had once been closely entwined but had drifted far apart over time. And he did this not by exporting the methods of economics to the analysis of politics, as others had done, but by emphasizing the importance of political activity within the economic sphere.<br /><br />This kind of interdisciplinarity permeated all of Albert’s work. He described the idea of <i>trespassing</i> as \"basic to his thinking.\" Crossing boundaries came naturally to him; he was too restless and playful to be confined to a single discipline. He was also an intellectual rebel, eager to question conventional wisdom whenever he found it wanting. In fact, he did so even when the conventional wisdom had been established by his own prior work. He referred to this as a propensity to <i>self-subversion</i>, which he called a \"permanent trait of his intellectual personality.\"<br /><br />I recall vividly and fondly my very first contact with Albert’s work. I had just begun graduate school, having never previously studied economics, and found myself in a course on the History of Economic Thought with the legendary Robert Heilbroner. It was Heilbroner’s book <i>The Worldly Philosophers</i> that had steered me to economics in the first place. And there on his syllabus, alongside Smith and Ricardo and Malthus, was Albert’s book <i>The Passions and the Interests</i>.<br /><br />I recently went back and read this extraordinary book for a second time. The twentieth anniversary edition has a foreword by Amartya Sen, who considers it to be \"among the finest\" of Albert’s writings. Albert himself, in the preface to this edition, notes that it’s the one book that never fell victim to his propensity to self-subversion.<br /><br />There’s a memorable passage in the book where Albert discusses Adam Smith’s claim that \"order and good government\" came to England as the unintended consequence of a growing taste for manufactured luxuries among the feudal elite. They \"bartered their whole power and authority,\" says Smith, for the \"gratification of… vanities… for trinkets and baubles, better fit to be the playthings of children than the serious pursuits of man.\" Having squandered their wealth in this manner, they could no longer support their vast armies of retainers, and became incapable of \"disturbing the peace\" or \"interrupting the regular execution of justice.\"<br /><br />But Albert was skeptical that the feudal lords had been quite so blind to their long-term interests. He felt that Smith, always eager to uncover the unintended effects of human action, had overreached this time. And he expressed this thought as follows:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">One cannot help feeling that in this particular instance, Smith overplayed his Invisible Hand.</blockquote>I can just imagine the smile that spread across Albert’s face when he came up with that turn of phrase.<br /><br />Albert’s work was expansive and visionary, bold and audacious, breathtakingly original and creative. But most of all, it was playful and gently irreverent. He demonstrated to us, by his own example, the happiness of <i>intellectual</i> pursuit. For that, more than anything else, I’ll always be grateful.</div><div><br /></div>" "http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/feeds/6219099593619051451/comments/default" (20815 48645) old 8 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4039434.post-6219099593619051451") (published nil "2013-03-24T23:00:00.002-04:00") (updated nil "2013-03-24T23:01:25.969-04:00") (title ((type .

At some point I was thinking about the fundamental rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence and that beautiful expression of American freedom as \"the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"I noted how, in addition to the pursuit of happiness, one might also underline the importance of the <i>happiness of pursuit</i>, which is precisely the felicity of taking part in collective action. I simply was happy when that play on words occurred to me.</blockquote>This idea of the <i>happiness of pursuit</i>, the pleasure that one takes in collective action, was to be a central theme in his masterpiece <i>Exit, Voice and Loyalty</i>, published in 1970. Two centuries earlier, Adam Smith had spoken of our propensity to \"truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.\" Albert Hirschman spoke instead of a propensity to protest, complain, and generally \"kick up a fuss.\" This articulation of discontent he called <i>Voice</i>.<br /><br />Albert believed that voice was an important factor in arresting and reversing decline in firms, organizations, and states. Economists to that point had focused on a very different mechanism, namely desertion or <i>exit</i>, and had argued that greater competition, in the form of greater ease of exit, was a beneficial force in maintaining high levels of organizational performance.<br /><br />Albert pointed out that there was a trade-off between exit and voice; that greater ease of exit could result in a stifling of voice as the individuals most inclined to protest and complain chose to depart instead. He also observed that <i>loyalty</i>, provided that it was not completely blind and uncritical, could serve to delay exit and thus create the space for voice to do its work.<br /><br />What Albert did in <i>Exit, Voice and Loyalty</i> was nothing less than to reunite two disciplines, economics and political science, which had once been closely entwined but had drifted far apart over time. And he did this not by exporting the methods of economics to the analysis of politics, as others had done, but by emphasizing the importance of political activity within the economic sphere.<br /><br />This kind of interdisciplinarity permeated all of Albert’s work. He described the idea of <i>trespassing</i> as \"basic to his thinking.\" Crossing boundaries came naturally to him; he was too restless and playful to be confined to a single discipline. He was also an intellectual rebel, eager to question conventional wisdom whenever he found it wanting. In fact, he did so even when the conventional wisdom had been established by his own prior work. He referred to this as a propensity to <i>self-subversion</i>, which he called a \"permanent trait of his intellectual personality.\"<br /><br />I recall vividly and fondly my very first contact with Albert’s work. I had just begun graduate school, having never previously studied economics, and found myself in a course on the History of Economic Thought with the legendary Robert Heilbroner. It was Heilbroner’s book <i>The Worldly Philosophers</i> that had steered me to economics in the first place. And there on his syllabus, alongside Smith and Ricardo and Malthus, was Albert’s book <i>The Passions and the Interests</i>.<br /><br />I recently went back and read this extraordinary book for a second time. The twentieth anniversary edition has a foreword by Amartya Sen, who considers it to be \"among the finest\" of Albert’s writings. Albert himself, in the preface to this edition, notes that it’s the one book that never fell victim to his propensity to self-subversion.<br /><br />There’s a memorable passage in the book where Albert discusses Adam Smith’s claim that \"order and good government\" came to England as the unintended consequence of a growing taste for manufactured luxuries among the feudal elite. They \"bartered their whole power and authority,\" says Smith, for the \"gratification of… vanities… for trinkets and baubles, better fit to be the playthings of children than the serious pursuits of man.\" Having squandered their wealth in this manner, they could no longer support their vast armies of retainers, and became incapable of \"disturbing the peace\" or \"interrupting the regular execution of justice.\"<br /><br />But Albert was skeptical that the feudal lords had been quite so blind to their long-term interests. He felt that Smith, always eager to uncover the unintended effects of human action, had overreached this time. And he expressed this thought as follows:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">One cannot help feeling that in this particular instance, Smith overplayed his Invisible Hand.</blockquote>I can just imagine the smile that spread across Albert’s face when he came up with that turn of phrase.<br /><br />Albert’s work was expansive and visionary, bold and audacious, breathtakingly original and creative. But most of all, it was playful and gently irreverent. He demonstrated to us, by his own example, the happiness of <i>intellectual</i> pursuit. For that, more than anything else, I’ll always be grateful.</div><div><br /></div>") (link ((rel . "replies") (type . "application/atom+xml") (href .

"<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the many benefits of visiting <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/default.aspx\">Microsoft Research</a> this semester is that I get to attend some interesting talks by computer scientists working with social and economic data.

The following chart sums it up:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCLzfJbJSfQ/US98aF1-CQI/AAAAAAAAB6k/8WaXZNKuK6E/s1600/GrouponYelp.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCLzfJbJSfQ/US98aF1-CQI/AAAAAAAAB6k/8WaXZNKuK6E/s400/GrouponYelp.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />The trend line is a 30 day moving average, but re-initialized on the launch date (so the first few points after this date average just a few observations). There is a second sharp decline after about 180 days, as the coupons are about to expire. The chart also shows the volume of ratings, which surges after the launch date. Part of the surge is driven by raters who explicitly reference Groupon (the darker volume bars). But not all Groupon users identify as such in their reviews, and about half the increase in ratings volume comes from ratings that do not reference Groupon.<br /><br />As is typical of computer scientists working with social data, the number of total observations is enormous. Almost 17,000 daily deals from over 5,000 businesses in 20 cities over a six month period are included, along with review histories for these businesses both during and prior to the observational window. In addition, the entire review histories of those who rated any of these businesses during the observational window were collected, expanding the set of reviews to over 7 million, and covering almost a million distinct businesses in all.<br /><br />So what accounts for the damage inflicted on Yelp ratings by Groupon campaigns? The authors explore several hypotheses. Groupon users could be especially harsh reviewers regardless of whether or not they are rating a Groupon business. Businesses may be overwhelmed by the rise in demand, resulting in a decline in quality for all customers. The service provided to Groupon users may be worse than that provided to customers paying full price. Customer preferences may be poorly matched to businesses they frequent using Groupons. Or the ratings prior to the campaign may be artificially inflated by fake positive reviews, which get swamped by more authentic reviews after the campaign. All of these seem plausible and consistent with anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />One hypothesis that is rejected quite decisively by the data is that Groupon users tend to be harsh reviewers in general. To address this, the authors looked at the review histories of those who identified Groupon use for the businesses in the observational window. Most of these prior reviews do not involve Groupon use, which allows for a direct test of the hypothesis that these raters were harsh in general. It turns out that they were not. Groupon users tend to write detailed and informative reviews that are more likely to be considered valuable, cool and funny by their peers. But they do not rate businesses without Groupon campaigns more harshly than other reviewers.<br /><br />What about the hypothesis of businesses being overwhelmed by the rise in demand? Since only about half the surge in reviews comes from those who explicitly reference Groupon, the remaining ratings pool together non-Groupon customers with those who don't reveal Groupon use. This makes a decline in ratings by the latter group hard to interpret. <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/jcl/\">John Langford</a> (who was in the audience) noted that if the entire surge in reviews could be attributed to Groupon users, and if undeclared and declared users had the same ratings on average, then one could infer the effect of the campaign on the ratings of regular customers. This seems worth pursuing.<br /><br />Anecdotal evidence on discriminatory treatment of customers paying discounted prices is plentiful (the authors mention the notorious <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/11/pf/groupon_ftd_deal_backlash/index.htm\">FTD flowers case</a>&nbsp;for instance). If mistreatment of coupon-carrying customers by a few bad apples were bringing down the ratings average, then a campaign should result in a more negatively skewed distribution of ratings relative to the pre-launch baseline. The authors look for this shift in skewness and find some evidence for it, but the effect is not large enough to account for the entire drop in the average rating.<br /><br />To test the hypothesis that ratings prior to a campaign are artificially inflated by fake or purchased reviews, the authors look at the rate at which reviews by self-identified Groupon users are filtered, compared with the corresponding rate for reviews that make no mention of Groupon. (Yelp allows filtered reviews to be seen, though they are harder to access and are not used in the computation of ratings). Reviews referencing Groupon are filtered much less often, suggesting that they are more likely to be authentic. If Yelp's filtering algorithm is lenient enough to let a number of fake reviews through, then the post-campaign ratings will be not just more numerous but also more authentic and less glowing.<br /><br />Finally, consider the possibility of a mismatch between the preferences of Groupon users and the businesses whose offers they accept. To look for evidence of this, the authors consider the extent to which reviews associated with Groupon use reveal experimentation on the part of the consumer. This is done by comparing the business category and location to the categories and locations in the reviewer's history. Experimentation is said to occur when the business category or zipcode differs from any in the reviewer's history. The data provide strong support for the hypothesis that individuals are much more likely to be experimenting in this sense when using a Groupon than when not. And such experimentation could plausibly lead to a greater incidence of disappointment.<br /><br />This point deserves further elaboration. Even without experimentation on categories or locations, an individual who accepts a daily deal has a lower anticipated valuation for the product or service than someone who pays full price. Even if the expectations of both types of buyers are met, and each feels that they have gotten what they paid for, there will be differences in the ratings they assign. To take an extreme case, if the product were available for free, many buyers would emerge who consider the product essentially worthless, and would rate it accordingly even if their expectations are met.<br /><br />There may be a lesson here for companies contemplating Groupon campaigns. Perhaps the Yelp rating would suffer less damage if the discount itself were not as steep. At present there is very little variation in discounts, which are mostly clustered around 50%. So there's no way to check whether smaller discounts actually result in better ratings relative to larger discounts. But it certainly seems worth exploring, at least for businesses that depend on strong ratings to thrive.<br /><br />The Groupon strategy of prioritizing growth above earnings had been <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/04/groupon_earnings_report_the_shaky_theory_behind_the_company_s_business_model_.html\">criticized</a> on the grounds that there are few barriers to entry in this industry, and no network externalities that can protect an incumbent from competition. But if the link between campaigns and ratings can't be broken, there may be deeper problems with the business model than a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/technology/groupon-dismisses-its-chief-andrew-mason.html\">change of leadership</a>&nbsp;or strategy can solve.</div>" "http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/feeds/8496386632080449328/comments/default" (20799 25795) old 10 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4039434.post-8496386632080449328") (published nil "2013-03-01T21:23:00.003-05:00") (updated nil "2013-03-12T13:24:19.154-04:00") (title ((type .

Groupon users tend to write detailed and informative reviews that are more likely to be considered valuable, cool and funny by their peers. But they do not rate businesses without Groupon campaigns more harshly than other reviewers.<br /><br />What about the hypothesis of businesses being overwhelmed by the rise in demand? Since only about half the surge in reviews comes from those who explicitly reference Groupon, the remaining ratings pool together non-Groupon customers with those who don't reveal Groupon use. This makes a decline in ratings by the latter group hard to interpret. <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/jcl/\">John Langford</a> (who was in the audience) noted that if the entire surge in reviews could be attributed to Groupon users, and if undeclared and declared users had the same ratings on average, then one could infer the effect of the campaign on the ratings of regular customers. This seems worth pursuing.<br /><br />Anecdotal evidence on discriminatory treatment of customers paying discounted prices is plentiful (the authors mention the notorious <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/11/pf/groupon_ftd_deal_backlash/index.htm\">FTD flowers case</a>&nbsp;for instance). If mistreatment of coupon-carrying customers by a few bad apples were bringing down the ratings average, then a campaign should result in a more negatively skewed distribution of ratings relative to the pre-launch baseline. The authors look for this shift in skewness and find some evidence for it, but the effect is not large enough to account for the entire drop in the average rating.<br /><br />To test the hypothesis that ratings prior to a campaign are artificially inflated by fake or purchased reviews, the authors look at the rate at which reviews by self-identified Groupon users are filtered, compared with the corresponding rate for reviews that make no mention of Groupon. (Yelp allows filtered reviews to be seen, though they are harder to access and are not used in the computation of ratings). Reviews referencing Groupon are filtered much less often, suggesting that they are more likely to be authentic. If Yelp's filtering algorithm is lenient enough to let a number of fake reviews through, then the post-campaign ratings will be not just more numerous but also more authentic and less glowing.<br /><br />Finally, consider the possibility of a mismatch between the preferences of Groupon users and the businesses whose offers they accept. To look for evidence of this, the authors consider the extent to which reviews associated with Groupon use reveal experimentation on the part of the consumer. This is done by comparing the business category and location to the categories and locations in the reviewer's history. Experimentation is said to occur when the business category or zipcode differs from any in the reviewer's history. The data provide strong support for the hypothesis that individuals are much more likely to be experimenting in this sense when using a Groupon than when not. And such experimentation could plausibly lead to a greater incidence of disappointment.<br /><br />This point deserves further elaboration. Even without experimentation on categories or locations, an individual who accepts a daily deal has a lower anticipated valuation for the product or service than someone who pays full price. Even if the expectations of both types of buyers are met, and each feels that they have gotten what they paid for, there will be differences in the ratings they assign. To take an extreme case, if the product were available for free, many buyers would emerge who consider the product essentially worthless, and would rate it accordingly even if their expectations are met.<br /><br />There may be a lesson here for companies contemplating Groupon campaigns. Perhaps the Yelp rating would suffer less damage if the discount itself were not as steep. At present there is very little variation in discounts, which are mostly clustered around 50%. So there's no way to check whether smaller discounts actually result in better ratings relative to larger discounts. But it certainly seems worth exploring, at least for businesses that depend on strong ratings to thrive.<br /><br />The Groupon strategy of prioritizing growth above earnings had been <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/04/groupon_earnings_report_the_shaky_theory_behind_the_company_s_business_model_.html\">criticized</a> on the grounds that there are few barriers to entry in this industry, and no network externalities that can protect an incumbent from competition. But if the link between campaigns and ratings can't be broken, there may be deeper problems with the business model than a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/technology/groupon-dismisses-its-chief-andrew-mason.html\">change of leadership</a>&nbsp;or strategy can solve.</div>") (link ((rel .

It's a lively and stimulating place and there are a number of interesting projects underway. In this post I'd like to report on one of these, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.predictwise.com/\">prediction market</a>&nbsp;developed by a team composed of David Pennock, David Rothschild, Miroslav Dudik, Jennifer Vaughan, and Sébastien Lahaie. <br /><br />This market is very different from peer-to-peer real money prediction markets such as IEM or Intrade, in that individual participants take positions not against each other but against an algorithmic market maker that adjusts prices in response to orders placed. Furthermore, a broad and complex range of events are priced, orders of arbitrary size can be met, and consistency across prices is maintained by the immediate identification and exploitation of arbitrage opportunities.<br /><br />The market for <a href=\"http://wiseq.predictwise.com/2013oscars/index.php\">Oscar predictions</a> is now live,&nbsp;and it's easy to participate. You can log in with a google account (or facebook or twitter) or create a new PredictWise account. You'll be credited with 1000 points which may be used to buy a range of contracts. These include contracts on <a href=\"http://wiseq.predictwise.com/2013oscars/oscars_winners.php\">simple events</a>, such as \"Lincoln to win Best Picture.\" But they also include events that reference <a href=\"http://wiseq.predictwise.com/2013oscars/oscars_films.php\">multiple categories</a>: you can bet on the event \"Argo to win Best Picture and Daniel Day-Lewis to win Best Actor in a Leading Role,\" or \"Zero Dark Thirty to win between 3 and 5 awards\" for example.<br /><br />All of these contracts are priced but the price is sensitive to order size. For small orders one can buy at the currently posted odds. &nbsp;For instance, for \"Lincoln to win Best Picture,\" current odds are 10.4%, so an expenditure of 0.104 units will return 1 unit if the event occurs:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ha4OkFAfRE/USPeD3_zQSI/AAAAAAAAB6M/gngZJHZRFp8/s1600/Prediction+Market.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"337\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ha4OkFAfRE/USPeD3_zQSI/AAAAAAAAB6M/gngZJHZRFp8/s400/Prediction+Market.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />But placing a larger order, say for 1.04 units, returns less than 10:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zCDqFSJ4aGQ/USPeJUJaiCI/AAAAAAAAB6U/V7n2lyFPEoo/s1600/Prediction+Market+2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"338\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zCDqFSJ4aGQ/USPeJUJaiCI/AAAAAAAAB6U/V7n2lyFPEoo/s400/Prediction+Market+2.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />The functional relationship between the price and quantity vectors is deterministic and satisfies three conditions: (i) the purchase of a contract (or portfolio) raises its price smoothly, (ii) this happens in such a manner as to bound the maximum possible loss incurred by the market maker, no matter how large the order size, (iii) contracts that are obvious complements, such as \"Lincoln to win Best Picture\" and \"Lincoln not to win Best Picture\" have prices that sum to 1. <br /><br />What makes this market interesting is that the algorithm ensures consistency in prices across linked contracts, quickly exploiting and eliminating any arbitrage opportunities than might arise. Some of these arbitrage conditions are not immediately transparent, as the following simplified example reveals.<br /><br />Suppose that there were only two Oscar categories (Best Picture and Best Director) and consider the following seven events:<br /><ol><li>Lincoln to win Best Picture</li><li>Lincoln not to win Best Picture</li><li>Lincoln to win Best Director</li><li>Lincoln not to win Best Director</li><li>Lincoln to win 0 Oscars</li><li>Lincoln to win 1 Oscar</li><li>Lincoln to win 2 Oscars</li></ol>Let <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;denote the price of contract <i>i</i>, where <i>i</i> = 1,...,7, where each contract pays out one dollar if the event in question occurs. Clearly we must have<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>1<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= &nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>4</sub>&nbsp;= 1,&nbsp;</div><br />otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity. Similarly, we must have<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>5<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>7</sub>&nbsp;= 1.&nbsp;</div><br />Price adjustments in response to orders are such that these equalities are continuously maintained.   Somewhat less obviously, we must also have<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>1<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;= &nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+ 2<i>p</i><sub>7</sub>.</div><br />If this condition were violated, then one could construct a portfolio that guaranteed a positive profit no matter what the eventual outcome may be. To see this, suppose that prices were such that<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>p</i><sub>1<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+ 2<i>p</i><sub>7</sub>.</div><br />In this case, the following portfolio would yield a risk-free profit: buy one unit each of contracts 2, 4, and 6, and two units of contract 7. This would cost<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">(1<i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;p</i><sub>1</sub>) + (1 -&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>) + &nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>6<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>+ 2<i>p</i><sub>7<i>&nbsp;</i></sub>&nbsp;&lt; 2.</div><br />The payoff from this portfolio would be exactly 2, no matter how things turn out. If Lincoln wins no Oscars then contracts 2 and 4 each pay out one unit, if it wins one Oscar then contract 6 pays out a unit, in addition to either contract 2 or contract 4, and if it wins two Oscars then each of the two units of contract 7 pays out.<br /><br />In reality, there are more than two categories for which Lincoln has been nominated, and the arbitrage conditions are accordingly more complex. The point is that whenever trades occur that cause these conditions to be violated, the algorithm itself begins to execute additional trades that exploit the opportunity, shifting prices in such a manner as to restore parity. In peer-to-peer markets this activity is left to the participants themselves; trader developed algorithms have been in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/10/algorithms-arbitrage-and-overreaction.html\">widespread use</a>&nbsp;on Intrade for instance.<br /><br />One problem with peer-to-peer markets is that only a few contracts can have significant liquidity, and complex combinations of events will therefore not be transparently and consistently priced. But the design described here allows for the consistent valuation of any combination of events, at the cost of subjecting the market maker to potential loss. The pricing function is designed to place a bound on this loss, but it cannot be avoided entirely because market participants have access to information that the market maker lacks.<br /><br />Could this be a template for markets on compound events in the future? It certainly seems possible, if the internally generated arbitrage profits are large enough to compensate for the information disadvantage faced by the market maker. But at the moment this is a research initiative, focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the mechanism for aggregating distributed information.

Born in Berlin in 1915,&nbsp;he was educated in French and German. He would later gain fluency in Italian, then Spanish and English. He fled Berlin for Paris in 1933, and joined the French resistance in 1939. Fearful of being shot as a traitor by advancing German forces, he took on a new identity as a Frenchman, Albert Hermant. In 1941 he migrated to the United States, met and married Sarah Hirschman, joined the US Army, and soon found himself back in Europe as part of the war effort. After the end of hostilities he was involved in the development of the Marshall Plan, and subsequently spent four years in Bogotá where many of his ideas on economic development took shape. He and Sarah were married for more than seven decades; she died in January of this year.<br /><br />Not only did Hirschman write several brilliant books in what was his fourth or fifth language, he also entertained himself with the invention of palindromes. Many of these were collected together in a book, <i>Senile Lines</i> by <i>Dr. Awkward</i>, which he presented to his daughter Katya. Forms of expression mattered to him as much as the ideas themselves. In opposition to Mancur Olson, he believed that collective action was an activity that came naturally to us humans, and was thrilled to find that one could invert a phrase in the declaration of independence to express this inclination as \"the happiness of pursuit.\"<br /><div><br /></div>Hirschman's intellectual contributions were varied and many but the jewel in the crown is his masterpiece&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/04/astonishing-voice-of-albert-hirschman.html\">Exit, Voice and Loyalty</a>. In this one slim volume, he managed to overturn conventional wisdom on one issue after another, and chart several new directions for research.&nbsp;The book is concerned with the mechanisms that can arrest and reverse declines in the performance of firms, organizations, and states. It was the interplay of two such mechanisms - desertion and articulation, or exit and voice - which Hirschman considered to be of central importance.<br /><br />Exit, for instance through the departure of customers or employees or citizens in favor of a rival, can alert an organization to its own decline and set in motion corrective measures. But so can voice, or the articulation of discontent. Too rapid a rate of exit can undermine voice and result in organizational collapse instead of recovery. But a complete inability to exit can make voice futile, and poor performance can continue indefinitely.<br /><br />Poorly functioning organizations prefer that an exit option be available to their most strident critics, so that they are left with less demanding customers or members or citizens. Hence a moderate amount of exit can result in the worst of all worlds, \"an oppression of the weak by the incompetent and an exploitation of the poor by the lazy which is the more durable and stifling as it is both <i>unambitious</i> and <i>escapable</i>.\" Near-monopolies with exit options for the most severely discontented can therefore function more poorly than complete monopolies. It is not surprising that many dysfunctional states welcome the voluntary exile of their fiercest internal critics.<br /><br />The propensity to exit is itself determined by the extent of loyalty to a firm or state. Loyalty slows down the rate of exit and can allow an organization time to recover from lapses in performance. But blind loyalty, which stifles voice even as it prevents exit, can allow poor performance to persist. It is in the interest of organizations to promote loyalty and raise the \"price of exit\", but the short term gains from doing so can lead to eventual collapse as both mechanisms for recuperation are weakened.<br /><br />Among Hirschman's many targets were the Downsian model of political competition and the Median Voter Theorem.

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Albert Hirschman, among the greatest of social scientists, has died.&nbsp;He was truly one of a kind: always&nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=dgc5AAAAIAAJ\">trespassing</a>, relentlessly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=LlvD47cU-qAC\">self-subversive</a>, and never constrained by disciplinary <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=VDHlOwAACAAJ\">boundaries</a>.<br /><br />Hirschman's life was as <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2011/04/self-subversion-of-albert-hirschman.html\">extraordinary</a> as his work. Born in Berlin in 1915,&nbsp;he was educated in French and German. He would later gain fluency in Italian, then Spanish and English. He fled Berlin for Paris in 1933, and joined the French resistance in 1939. Fearful of being shot as a traitor by advancing German forces, he took on a new identity as a Frenchman, Albert Hermant. In 1941 he migrated to the United States, met and married Sarah Hirschman, joined the US Army, and soon found himself back in Europe as part of the war effort. After the end of hostilities he was involved in the development of the Marshall Plan, and subsequently spent four years in Bogotá where many of his ideas on economic development took shape. He and Sarah were married for more than seven decades; she died in January of this year.<br /><br />Not only did Hirschman write several brilliant books in what was his fourth or fifth language, he also entertained himself with the invention of palindromes. Many of these were collected together in a book, <i>Senile Lines</i> by <i>Dr. Awkward</i>, which he presented to his daughter Katya. Forms of expression mattered to him as much as the ideas themselves. In opposition to Mancur Olson, he believed that collective action was an activity that came naturally to us humans, and was thrilled to find that one could invert a phrase in the declaration of independence to express this inclination as \"the happiness of pursuit.\"<br /><div><br /></div>Hirschman's intellectual contributions were varied and many but the jewel in the crown is his masterpiece&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/04/astonishing-voice-of-albert-hirschman.html\">Exit, Voice and Loyalty</a>. In this one slim volume, he managed to overturn conventional wisdom on one issue after another, and chart several new directions for research.&nbsp;The book is concerned with the mechanisms that can arrest and reverse declines in the performance of firms, organizations, and states. It was the interplay of two such mechanisms - desertion and articulation, or exit and voice - which Hirschman considered to be of central importance.<br /><br />Exit, for instance through the departure of customers or employees or citizens in favor of a rival, can alert an organization to its own decline and set in motion corrective measures. But so can voice, or the articulation of discontent. Too rapid a rate of exit can undermine voice and result in organizational collapse instead of recovery. But a complete inability to exit can make voice futile, and poor performance can continue indefinitely.<br /><br />Poorly functioning organizations prefer that an exit option be available to their most strident critics, so that they are left with less demanding customers or members or citizens. Hence a moderate amount of exit can result in the worst of all worlds, \"an oppression of the weak by the incompetent and an exploitation of the poor by the lazy which is the more durable and stifling as it is both <i>unambitious</i> and <i>escapable</i>.\" Near-monopolies with exit options for the most severely discontented can therefore function more poorly than complete monopolies. It is not surprising that many dysfunctional states welcome the voluntary exile of their fiercest internal critics.<br /><br />The propensity to exit is itself determined by the extent of loyalty to a firm or state. Loyalty slows down the rate of exit and can allow an organization time to recover from lapses in performance. But blind loyalty, which stifles voice even as it prevents exit, can allow poor performance to persist. It is in the interest of organizations to promote loyalty and raise the \"price of exit\", but the short term gains from doing so can lead to eventual collapse as both mechanisms for recuperation are weakened.<br /><br />Among Hirschman's many targets were the Downsian model of political competition and the Median Voter Theorem. Since he considered collective action to be an expression of voice, readily adopted in response to dissatisfaction, there was no such thing as a \"captive voter.\" Those on the fringes of a political party could not be taken for granted simply because they had no exit option: the inability to exit &nbsp;just strengthened their inclination to exercise voice. This they would do with relish, driving parties away from the median voter, as political leaders trade-off the fear of exit by moderates against the threat of voice by extremists.<br /><br />Albert Hirschman lived a long and eventful life and was a joyfully iconoclastic thinker. His books will be read by generations to come. But he will always remain something of an outsider in the profession; his ideas are just too broad and interdisciplinary to find neat expression in models and textbooks.

While the earlier work examined transaction level data for four days in May 2010, the present study looks at the entire month of August 2010. Some of the new findings are startling,&nbsp;but need to be interpreted with greater care than is taken in the paper.<br /><br />High frequency traders are characterized by large volume, short holding periods, and limited overnight and intraday directional exposure:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For each day there are three categories a&nbsp;potential trader must satisfy to be considered a HFT: (1) Trade more than 10,000 contracts; (2) have an end-of-day inventory position of no more than 2% of the total contracts the firm traded that day; (3) have a maximum variation in inventory scaled by total contracts traded of less than&nbsp;15%. A firm must meet all three criteria on a given day to be considered engaging in HFT for that day. Furthermore, to be labeled an HFT firm for the purposes of this study, a firm must be&nbsp;labeled as engaging in HFT activity in at least 50% of the days it trades and must trade at least&nbsp;50% of possible trading days.&nbsp;</blockquote>Of more than 30,000 accounts in the data, only 31 fit this description. But these firms dominate the market, accounting for 47% of total trading volume and appearing on one or both sides&nbsp;of almost 75% of traded contracts. And they do this with minimal directional exposure: average intraday inventory amounts to just 2% of trading volume, and the overnight inventory of the median HFT firm is precisely zero.<br /><br />This small set of firms is then further subdivided into categories based on the extent to which they are providers of liquidity. For any given trade, the liquidity taker is the&nbsp;firm that initiates the transaction, by submitting an order that is marketable against one that is resting in the order book. The counterparty to the trade (who previously submitted the resting limit order) is the liquidity provider. Based on this criterion, the authors partition the set of high frequency traders into three subcategories: aggressive, mixed, and passive:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To be considered an Aggressive HFT, a firm must... initiate at least 40% of the trades it enters into, and must do so for at least 50% of the trading days in which it is active. To be considered a Passive HFT a firm must initiate fewer than 20% of the trades it enters into, and must do so for at least&nbsp;50% of the trading days during which it is active. Those HFTs that meet neither... definition are labeled as Mixed HFTs. There are 10 Aggressive, 11 Mixed, and 10&nbsp;Passive HFTs.</blockquote><div>This heterogeneity among high frequency traders conflicts with the common claim that such firms are generally net providers of liquidity. In fact, the authors find that \"some HFTs are almost&nbsp;100% liquidity takers, and these firms trade the most and are the most profitable.\"<br /><br />Given the richness of their data, the authors are able to compute profitability, risk-exposure, and measures of risk-adjusted performance for all firms. Gross profits are significant on average but show considerable variability across firms and over time. The average HFT makes over $46,000 a day; aggressive firms make more than twice this amount. The&nbsp;standard deviation of profits is five times the mean, and the authors find that \"there are a number of trader-days in which they lose money... several HFTs even lose over a million dollars in a single day.\"<br /><br />Despite the volatility in daily profits, the risk-adjusted performance of high frequency traders is found to be spectacular:</div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">HFTs earn above-average gross rates of return for the amount of risk they take. This is true overall and for each type... Overall, the average annualized Sharpe ratio for an HFT is 9.2. Among the subcategories, Aggressive HFTs (8.46) exhibit the lowest risk-return tradeoff, while Passive HFTs do slightly better (8.56) and Mixed HFTs achieve the best performance (10.46)... The distribution is wide, with an inter-quartile range of 2.23 to 13.89 for all HFTs. Nonetheless, even the low end of HFT risk-adjusted performance is seven times higher than the Sharpe ratio of the S&amp;P 500 (0.31).</blockquote><div>These are interesting findings, but there is a serious problem with this interpretation of risk-adjusted performance.&nbsp;The authors are observing only a partial portfolio for each firm, and cannot therefore determine the firm's overall risk exposure. It is extremely likely that these firms are trading simultaneously in many markets, in which case their exposure to risk in one market may be amplified or offset by their exposures elsewhere.&nbsp;The Sharpe ratio is meaningful only when applied to a firm's entire portfolio, not to any of its individual components. For instance, it is possible to construct a low risk portfolio with a high Sharpe ratio that is composed of several high risk components, each of which has a low Sharpe ratio.<br /><br />To take an extreme example, if aggressive firms are attempting to exploit arbitrage opportunities between the futures price and the spot price of a fund that tracks the index, then the authors would have significantly overestimated the firm's risk exposure by looking only at its position in the futures market. Over short intervals, such a strategy would result in losses in one market, offset and exceeded by gains in another. Within each market the firm would appear to have significant risk exposure, even while its aggregate exposure was minimal. Over longer periods, net gains will be more evenly distributed across markets, so the profitability of the strategy can be revealed by looking at just one market. But doing so would provide a very misleading picture of the firms risk exposure, since day-to-day variations in profitability within a single market can be substantial.<br /><br />The problem is compounded by the fact that there are likely to by systematic differences across firms in the degree to which they are trading in other markets. I suspect that the most aggressive firms are in fact trading across multiple markets in a manner that lowers rather than amplifies their exposure in the market under study. Under such circumstances, the claim that aggressive firms \"exhibit the lowest risk-return tradeoff\" is without firm foundation.<br /><br />Despite these problems of interpretation, the paper is extremely valuable because it provides a framework for thinking about the aggregate costs and benefits of high frequency trading. Since contracts in this market are in zero net supply, any profits accruing to one set of traders must come at the expense of others:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">From whom do these profits come? In addition to HFTs, we divide the remaining universe of traders in the E-mini market into four categories of traders: Fundamental traders (likely institutional), Non-HFT Market Makers, Small traders (likely retail), and Opportunistic traders... HFTs earn most of their profits from Opportunistic traders, but also earn profits from Fundamental traders, Small traders, and Non-HFT Market Makers. Small traders in particular suffer the&nbsp;highest loss to HFTs on a per contract basis.</blockquote>Within the class of high frequency traders is another hierarchy: mixed firms lose to aggressive ones, and passive firms lose to both of the other types.<br /><br />The operational costs incurred by such firms include payments for&nbsp;data feeds, computer systems, co-located servers, exchange fees, and highly specialized personnel. Most of these costs do not scale up in proportion to trading volume. Since the least active firms must have positive net profitability in order to survive, the net returns of the most aggressive traders must therefore be substantial.<br /><br />In thinking about the aggregate costs and benefits of all this activity, it's worth bringing to mind <a href=\"http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/WSJ_2-07.pdf\">Bogle's&nbsp;law</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">It is the iron law of the markets, the undefiable rules of arithmetic: Gross&nbsp;return in the market, less the costs of financial intermediation, equals the net return&nbsp;actually delivered to market participants.</blockquote>The costs to other market participants of high frequency trading correspond roughly to the gross profitability of this small set of firms. What about the benefits? The two most commonly cited are price discovery and liquidity provision. It appears that the net effect on liquidity of the most aggressive traders is negative even under routine market conditions.&nbsp;Furthermore, even normally passive firms can become liquidity takers under&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/10/rt-leuchtkafer-on-flash-crash-report.html\">stressed conditions</a>&nbsp;when liquidity is most needed but in vanishing supply.<br /><br />As far as price discovery is concerned, high frequency trading&nbsp;is based on a strategy of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/blame-instructions-not-machines.html\">information extraction</a>&nbsp;from market data. This can speed up the response to changes in fundamental information, and maintain price consistency across related assets. But the heavy lifting as far as price discovery is concerned is done by those who feed information to the market about the earnings potential of publicly traded companies. This kind of research cannot (yet) be done algorithmically.<br /><br />A great deal of trading activity in financial markets is privately profitable but wasteful in the aggregate, since it involves a shuffling of net returns with no discernible effect on production or economic growth. Jack Hirschleifer made this <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1811850\">point</a>&nbsp;way back in 1971, when the financial sector was a fraction of its current size. James Tobin <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/james-tobins-hirsch-lecture.html\">reiterated</a> these concerns a decade or so later.&nbsp;David Glasner, who was fortunate enough to have studied with Hirshlefier, has recently described our predicament <a href=\"http://uneasymoney.com/2012/03/28/soak-the-rich/\">thus</a>:</div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our current overblown financial sector is largely built on people hunting, scrounging, doing whatever they possibly can, to obtain any scrap of useful information — useful, that is for anticipating a price movement that can be traded on. But the net value to society from all the resources expended on that feverish, obsessive, compulsive, all-consuming search for information is close to zero (not exactly zero, but close to zero), because the gains from obtaining slightly better information are mainly obtained at some other trader’s expense. There is a net gain to society from faster adjustment of prices to their equilibrium levels, and there is a gain from the increased market liquidity resulting from increased trading generated by the acquisition of new information. But those gains are second-order compared to gains that merely reflect someone else’s losses. That’s why there is clearly overinvestment — perhaps massive overinvestment — in the mad quest for information.</blockquote>To this I would add the following: too great a proliferation of information extracting strategies is not only wasteful in the aggregate, it can also result in <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/algorithmic-trading-and-price.html\">market instability</a>. Any change in incentives that substantially lengthens holding periods and shifts the composition of trading strategies towards those that transmit rather than extract information could therefore be both stabilizing and growth enhancing.&nbsp;</div>" "http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/feeds/33959229742114402/comments/default" (20674 17832) old 13 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4039434.post-33959229742114402") (published nil "2012-12-07T05:42:00.000-05:00") (updated nil "2012-12-07T14:38:16.772-05:00") (title ((type .

But those gains are second-order compared to gains that merely reflect someone else’s losses. That’s why there is clearly overinvestment — perhaps massive overinvestment — in the mad quest for information.</blockquote>To this I would add the following: too great a proliferation of information extracting strategies is not only wasteful in the aggregate, it can also result in <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/05/algorithmic-trading-and-price.html\">market instability</a>. Any change in incentives that substantially lengthens holding periods and shifts the composition of trading strategies towards those that transmit rather than extract information could therefore be both stabilizing and growth enhancing.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

But the contracts that made it famous - the US election markets - will dwindle and perhaps even disappear.

Individuals from all corners of the country with views spanning the ideological spectrum, and detailed knowledge of their own political subcultures, will no longer be able to participate. There will be a rebirth at some point, perhaps launched by a new entrant with regulatory approval, but for the moment there is a vacuum in a once vibrant corner of the political landscape.<br /><br />The closure was precipitated by a CFTC <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6423-12\">suit</a> alleging that the company \"solicited and permitted\" US persons to buy and sell commodity options without being a registered exchange, in violation of US law. But it <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/are-prediction-markets-against-the-public-interest.html\">appears</a> that hostility to prediction markets among regulators runs deeper than that, since an attempt by Nadex to register and offer binary options contracts on political events was previously&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6224-12\">denied</a>&nbsp;on the grounds that \"the contracts involve gaming and are contrary to the public interest.\"<br /><br />The CFTC did not specify why exactly such markets are contrary to the public interest, and it's worth <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennockd/status/273263505992474624\">asking</a> what the basis for such a position might be.<br /><br />I can think of two reasons, neither of which are particularly compelling in this context. First, all traders have to post margin equal to their worst-case loss, even though in the aggregate the payouts from all bets will net to zero. This means that cash is tied up as collateral to support speculative bets, when it could be put to more productive uses such as the financing of investment. This is a <a href=\"http://www.voxeu.org/article/economic-consequences-speculative-side-bets-case-naked-cds\">capital diversion</a> effect.&nbsp;Second, even though the exchange&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/aav2/safeFunds.html\">claims</a>&nbsp;to keep this margin in segregated accounts, separate from company funds, there is always the possibility that its deposits are not fully insured and could be lost if the Irish banking system were to collapse. These losses would ultimately be incurred by traders, who would then have very limited legal recourse.<br /><br />These arguments are not without merit. But if one really wanted to restrain the diversion of capital to support speculative positions, Intrade is hardly the place to start. Vastly greater amounts of collateral are tied up in support of speculation using interest rate and currency swaps, credit derivatives, options, and futures contracts. It is true that such contracts can also be used to reduce risk exposures, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/11/27/the-folly-of-making-political-prediction-markets-like-intrade-illegal/\">so can</a>&nbsp;prediction markets.

In comparison with the scale of betting in licensed exchanges and over-the-counter swaps, Intrade's capital diversion effect is truly negligible.<br /><br />The second argument, concerning the segregation and safety of funds, is more relevant. Even if the exchange maintains a strict separation of company funds from posted margin despite the absence of regulatory oversight, there's always the possibility that its <a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/aav2/safeFunds.html\">deposits</a> in the Irish banking system are not fully secure. Sophisticated traders are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bb.intrade.com/intradeForum/posts/list/492830.page\">well aware</a>&nbsp;of this risk, which could be&nbsp;substantially mitigated (though clearly <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/03/us-mfglobal-funds-idUSTRE7B203J20111203\">not eliminated</a>&nbsp;entirely) by licensing and regulation.<br /><br />In judging the wisdom of the CFTC action, it's also worth considering the <a href=\"http://hanson.gmu.edu/promisepredmkt.pdf\">benefits</a> that prediction markets provide.

Software could not be patented before 1981, nor financial securities prior to 1998, yet both industries witnessed innovation at a blistering pace. The fashion industry remains largely untouched by intellectual property law, yet new designs keep appearing and enriching their creators. Innovative techniques in professional sports continue to be developed, despite the fact that successful ones are quickly copied and disseminated.<br /><br />In 19th century publishing, British authors had limited protection in the United States but managed to secure lucrative deals with publishers, allowing the latter to saturate the market at low prices before new entrants could gain a foothold. More recently, commercial publishers have turned a profit selling millions of copies of unprotected government documents. For instance, the 9/11 Commission Report was published by both <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OCDdPk1ssC\">Norton</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=r6agY6DUEJsC\">Macmillan</a> in 2004, and a third version by <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=TjKODEaahVQC\">Cosimo</a> is now available.<br /><br />Copyright restrictions for scientific papers are especially illogical, since faculty authors benefit from the widest possible dissemination and citation of their work. Furthermore, in the case of journals owned by commercial publishers, copyright is typically transferred by the author to the publisher.&nbsp;Neither the content creators nor the uncompensated peer-reviewers who evaluate manuscripts for publication benefit from protection in such cases. Fortunately, thanks to the emergence of new high-quality open-source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.econtheory.org/\">journals</a> sponsored by academic societies, things are starting to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/03/future-of-academic-publishing.html\">change</a>.<br /><br />It's not clear why the policy brief was taken down, or what motivated it in the first place. Henry Farrell, while agreeing with the positions taken in the report, <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/11/17/radicals-for-capitalism/\">argues</a> that damage to an industry that has historically supported Democrats may be a factor.

The fashion industry remains largely untouched by intellectual property law, yet new designs keep appearing and enriching their creators. Innovative techniques in professional sports continue to be developed, despite the fact that successful ones are quickly copied and disseminated.<br /><br />In 19th century publishing, British authors had limited protection in the United States but managed to secure lucrative deals with publishers, allowing the latter to saturate the market at low prices before new entrants could gain a foothold. More recently, commercial publishers have turned a profit selling millions of copies of unprotected government documents. For instance, the 9/11 Commission Report was published by both <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OCDdPk1ssC\">Norton</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=r6agY6DUEJsC\">Macmillan</a> in 2004, and a third version by <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=TjKODEaahVQC\">Cosimo</a> is now available.<br /><br />Copyright restrictions for scientific papers are especially illogical, since faculty authors benefit from the widest possible dissemination and citation of their work. Furthermore, in the case of journals owned by commercial publishers, copyright is typically transferred by the author to the publisher.&nbsp;Neither the content creators nor the uncompensated peer-reviewers who evaluate manuscripts for publication benefit from protection in such cases. Fortunately, thanks to the emergence of new high-quality open-source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.econtheory.org/\">journals</a> sponsored by academic societies, things are starting to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/03/future-of-academic-publishing.html\">change</a>.<br /><br />It's not clear why the policy brief was taken down, or what motivated it in the first place. Henry Farrell, while agreeing with the positions taken in the report, <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/11/17/radicals-for-capitalism/\">argues</a> that damage to an industry that has historically supported Democrats may be a factor. In contrast,&nbsp;Jordan Bloom and Alex Tabarrok <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-astonishing-cravenness-of-the-rsc/\">both</a> <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/dont-mess-with-the-mouse.html\">believe</a> that pressure on Republicans from the entertainment industry led to the brief being withdrawn.&nbsp;They can't all be right as far as I can see. But less interesting than the motivation for the report is its content, and the long overdue debate on patents and copyrights that could finally be stirred in its wake.&nbsp;</div>") (link ((rel .

Television broadcasts still provide the core pubic information around which expectations are formed, but blogs and twitter feeds are sources of customized private information that can have significant effects on the evolution of beliefs. And prediction markets aggregate this private information and channel it back into the public sphere.<br /><br />All of this activity has an impact not only on our beliefs and moods, but also on our behavior. In particular, beliefs that one's candidate of choice has lost can affect turnout. It has been argued, for instance, that early projections of victory for Reagan in 1980 depressed Democratic turnout in California, and that Republican turnout in Florida was similarly affected in 2000 when the state was called for Gore while voting in the panhandle was still underway. For this reason, early exit poll data is kept tightly under wraps these days, and states are called for one candidate or another only after polls have closed.<br /><br />This effect of beliefs on behavior implies that a candidate facing long odds of victory has an incentive to inflate these odds and project confidence in public statements, lest the demoralizing effects of pessimism cause the likelihood of victory to decline even further. Traditionally this would be done by partisans on television sketching out implausible scenarios and interpretations of the incoming data to boost their supporters. But with the increasing visibility of prediction markets, this strategy is much less effective. If a collapse in the price of a contract on Intrade reveals that a candidate is doing much worse than expected, no amount of cheap talk on television can do much to change the narrative.<br /><br />Given this, the incentives to interfere with what the markets are saying becomes quite powerful. Even though trading volume has risen dramatically in prediction markets over recent years, the amount of money required to have a sustained price impact for a few hours remains quite small, especially in comparison with the vast sums now spent on advertising.<br /><br />In general, I believe that observers are too quick to allege manipulation when they see unusual price movements in such markets. As I noted in an <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/10/algorithms-arbitrage-and-overreaction.html\">earlier post</a>, a spike in the price of the Romney contract a few days ago was probably driven by naive traders over-reacting to rumors of a game-changing announcement by Donald Trump, rather than by any systematic attempt at price manipulation. My reasons for thinking so were based on the fact that frenzied purchases of a single contract (while ignoring complementary contracts) are terribly ineffective if the goal is to have a sustained impact on prices. If one really wants to manipulate a market, it has to be done by placing large orders that serve as price ceilings and floors, and to do this across complementary contracts in a consistent way.<br /><br />As it happens, this is exactly what someone tried to do yesterday. At around 3:30 pm, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">noticed</a> that the order book for both Obama and Romney contracts on Intrade had become unusually asymmetric, with a large block of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265916890466091008\">buy orders</a> for Romney in the 28-30 range, and a corresponding block of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/265917575261720576\">sell orders</a> for Obama in the 70-72 range. Here's the Romney order book:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X-EVZpNeNpI/UJrKzsWsfUI/AAAAAAAAB5A/TKROHnRcpQU/s1600/RomneyBook.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X-EVZpNeNpI/UJrKzsWsfUI/AAAAAAAAB5A/TKROHnRcpQU/s320/RomneyBook.png\" width=\"180\" /></a></div>And here's the book for Obama:  <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CwSn748ZHIA/UJrK45wS0eI/AAAAAAAAB5I/uecwiTAI9-M/s1600/ObamaBook.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CwSn748ZHIA/UJrK45wS0eI/AAAAAAAAB5I/uecwiTAI9-M/s320/ObamaBook.png\" width=\"182\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br />Since the exchange requires traders to post 100% margin (to cover their worst case loss and eliminate counterparty risk), the funds required to place these orders was about $240,000 in total. A non-trivial amount, but probably less than the cost of a thirty-second commercial during primetime.<br /><br />Could this not have been just a big bet, placed by someone optimistic about Romney's chances? I don't think so, for two reasons. First, if one wanted to bet on Romney rather than Obama, much better odds were available elsewhere, for instance on Betfair. More importantly, one would not want to leave such large orders standing at a time when new information was emerging rapidly; the risk of having the orders met by someone with superior information would be too great. Yet these orders stood for hours, and effectively placed a floor on the Romney price and a ceiling on the price for Obama.<br /><br />Meanwhile odds in other markets were shifting rapidly. Nate Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/live-blog-the-2012-presidential-election/?src=twt&amp;twt=fivethirtyeight#differences-in-political-betting-markets-persist\">noticed</a> the widening disparity and was puzzled by it, arguing that differences across markets should \"evaporate on Election Day itself, when the voting is over and there is little seeming benefit from affecting the news media coverage.\" Much as I <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/12/is-nate-sliver-worlds-22nd-best.html\">admire</a> Nate, I think that he was mistaken here. It is precisely on election day that market manipulation makes most sense, since one only needs to affect media coverage for a few hours until all relevant polls have closed. Voting was still ongoing in Colorado, and keeping Romney viable there was the only hope of stitching together a victory. Florida, Virginia and Ohio were all close at the time and none had been called for Obama. A loss in Colorado would have made these three states irrelevant and a Romney victory virtually impossible.<br /><br />Given this interpretation, I felt that the floor would collapse once the Colorado polls closed at 9pm Eastern Time, and this is precisely what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/266004367281360896\">happened</a>:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bVdLFOBeRm4/UJpptzZxc8I/AAAAAAAAB4w/Nnz9I41afCY/s1600/FloorRomney.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"126\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bVdLFOBeRm4/UJpptzZxc8I/AAAAAAAAB4w/Nnz9I41afCY/s400/FloorRomney.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Once the floor gave way, the price fell to single digits in a matter of minutes and never recovered. <br /><br />It turned out, of course, that none of this was to matter: Virginia, Ohio, and (probably) Florida have all fallen to Obama. But all were close, and the possibility of a different outcome could not have been ruled out at the time. The odds were low, and a realistic projection of these odds would have made them even lower. Such is the <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/01/on-prediction-markets-and-self.html\">positive feedback</a> loop between beliefs and outcomes in politics. Under the circumstances, the loss of a few hundred thousand dollars to keep alive the prospect of a Romney victory probably seemed like a good investment to someone.<br /><br />Should one be concerned about such attempts at manipulation?

And if not, are they somehow deluded or dumb?<br /><br />I believe that it is Arena and Levitt who are mistaken about the rationality of voting, and not the voters themselves. The premise of their argument is correct, but not the conclusions they draw from it. The&nbsp;likelihood of a single vote being decisive is negligible in all states, and voters by and large are fully cognizant of this fact. And yet it is perfectly rational for some voters to incur significant costs to vote in New York, and to incur even greater costs to do so in Ohio.<br /><br />To see why, one needs only to recognize that the elation one feels when a preferred candidate wins depends both on the margin of victory and on whether or not one has cast a ballot. A single voter cannot materially affect the former, but can certainly determine the latter. Furthermore, the margin of victory can be forecast with a fair amount of accuracy: there is little doubt that the margin in Ohio, no matter who wins tomorrow, will be smaller than that in New York. Provided that the joy of celebrating a victory is greater when one has cast a ballot, and especially so when the margin of victory is small, it makes perfect sense to incur greater costs to vote in Ohio than in New York.<br /><br />Similar arguments apply to the grief that comes with defeat. In this case it is the failure to cast a ballot when the margin is tight that can give rise to great regret. People in this situation are perfectly well aware that their vote alone would not have materially affected the outcome, but they are not much comforted by this thought.&nbsp;The point is that if a relatively small coalition could have jointly generated a different outcome, then one's failure to join such a coalition can be a cause of distress. There is nothing irrational about such preferences, and they clearly lead to greater turnout when and where elections are predicted to be close. This turnout differential is not based on mistaken beliefs about what one alone can accomplish, and is not driven by cognitive limitations either.<br /><br />This perspective on voting also explains why people often vote strategically, rather than always voting their conscience. Think of Nader supporters contemplating a vote for Gore in 2000. The size of the coalition of such supporters who could have blocked a Bush victory in Florida turned out to be extremely small, and the possibility that Nader could play such a spoiler role in the election was certainly anticipated. Some of those who chose to vote their conscience may well have regretted this choice once the outcome of the election was finally determined, and some who chose to vote for Gore may well have done so to avoid such regret. The fact that no single voter was decisive is entirely irrelevant. Collective responsibility for coalitional choices comes naturally to us, especially when the groups involved are not large.

Over the next three minutes the price rose sharply to 48.5, with a further 1700 contracts traded. This was followed by sharp oscillating movements between the peak and 42, which can be seen as the red blur at around 10am in the chart. By 10:15 the price had fallen to 43 and the oscillations had mostly ceased.

(I am fairly certain that this was a single trader). Throughout the buying frenzy, the Obama contract never fell below 57 and there was a substantial block of bids at or above this price. The trader who was buying Romney at 48 could have made the same bet for 43 by simply selling the Obama contract at 57. In fact, he would have obtained a slightly superior contract, which would pay off if any person other than Obama were to win, including but not limited to Romney.<br /><br />This fact also explains the oscillations in the Romney price, and the decline to 57 under selling pressure of the Obama price. Any individual who had posted ask prices in the 43-48 range in the Romney market had these orders met by the crazed buyer, and could then sell Obama above 57 for an immediate arbitrage profit. As it happens, there are algorithms active on Intrade that do precisely this. They post ask prices that, together with with highest bid in the complementary contract, add up to slightly more than 100. As soon as these orders trade, they sell the complementary contract at once, booking a riskless profit. These algorithms posted prices in the 42-43 range over the period in question, and the buyer repeatedly traded through them to reach the higher Romney asks. Hence the red blur in the chart.

But it's the economic analysis that&nbsp;will constitute the more enduring contribution.<br /><br />Among the many highlights are the following: a discussion of the linkages between securitization, credit derivatives and loan modifications, an exploration of the trade-off between regulatory capture and regulatory arbitrage, an intriguing question about the optimal timing of auctions for failing banks, a proposal for ending too big to fail that relies on simplification and asset segregation rather than balance sheet contraction, a full-throated defense of sensible financial regulation, and a passionate critique of bailouts for the powerful and politically connected even when such transactions appear to generate an accounting profit. <br /><br />Let's start with securitization, derivatives and loan modifications.&nbsp;Under the traditional model of mortgage lending, there are strong incentives for creditors to modify delinquent loans if the costs of doing so are lower than the very substantial deadweight losses that result from foreclosure. But pooling and tranching of mortgage loans creates a conflict of interest <i>within</i> the group of investors. As long as foreclosures are not widespread enough to affect holders of the overcollateralized senior tranches, all losses are inflicted upon those with junior claims. In contrast, loan modifications&nbsp;lower payments to all tranches, and will thus be resisted by holders of senior claims unless they truly see disaster looming. One consequence of this \"tranche warfare\" is that servicers, fearing lawsuits, will be inclined to favor foreclosure over modification.<br /><br />But this is not the end of the story. Bair points out that&nbsp;the interests of those using credit derivatives to bet on declines in home values are aligned with those of holders of senior tranches, as long as the latter continue to believe that foreclosures will not become widespread enough to eat into their protected positions. This is interesting because these two groups are taking quite different price views: one is long and the other short credit risk. Bair notes that some of the \"early resistance\" to FDIC loan modification initiatives came from fund managers who \"had purchased CDS protection against losses on mortgage-backed securities they did not own.\" The irony is that they were joined in this resistance by holders of senior tranches who were relying (overoptimistically, as it turned out) on&nbsp;the protective buffer provided by the holders of junior claims.<br /><br />Another interesting discussion in the book concerns the trade-off between regulatory arbitrage and regulatory capture.&nbsp;A fragmented regulatory structure with a variety of norms and standards encourages financial institutions to shop for the weakest regulator. In the lead up to the crisis, such regulatory shopping occurred between banks and nonbanks, with mortgage brokers and securities firms operating outside the stronger regulations imposed on insured banks. But Bair also notes that&nbsp;the \"three biggest problem institutions among insured banks - Citigroup, Wachovia, and WaMu - had not shopped for charters; they had been with the same regulator for decades. The problem was that their regulators did not have independence from them.\"<br /><br />This is the problem of regulatory capture. Bair argues that while a single monolithic regulator would put an end to regulatory arbitrage, it could worsen the problem of regulatory capture:&nbsp;\"a diversity of views and the ability of one agency to look over the shoulder of another is a good check against regulators becoming too close to the entities they regulate.\"&nbsp;It's a point that she has made&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/opinion/01bair.html\">before</a>, and clearly believes (with considerable justification) that the FDIC has provided such checks and balances in the past. It was able to do so in part through its power under the law and in part through the power to persuade; yet another reminder of the continued relevance of Albert Hirschman's notion of <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/04/astonishing-voice-of-albert-hirschman.html\">voice</a>.<br /><br />A very different kind of trade-off concerns the timing of auctions for failing banks. One of the policies that Bair favored at the FDIC was the quick sale of failing banks prior to closure in order to avoid a period of government stewardship. She recognizes, however, that there are some costs to this. Bids from prospective buyers who have not had time to closely examine the asset pool of the failing institution will tend to be lower than the expected value of these assets, given the need to maintain adequate margins of safety in the face of risk. Waiting until a more precise estimate of the value of the bank's assets can be obtained can therefore result in higher bids on average. But there are also costs to waiting: a \"deterioration of franchise value\" occurs as large depositors and business customers look elsewhere, and this can offset any gains from a more precise valuation of the asset pool. Bair seems to have concluded that sale before closure was always the best course of action, but I suspect that this need not be the case, especially when the asset pool is characterized by high expected value but great uncertainty, and the bulk of deposits are insured. In any case, it's a question deserving of systematic study.<br /><br />Bair describes herself as a lifelong Republican and McCain voter; she is contemplating a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/former-regulator-sheila-bair-financial-crisis\">write-in</a>&nbsp;vote for Jon Huntsman this November. Yet she seems quite immune to partisan loyalties and pressures.&nbsp;Her description of Barney Frank is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajivatbarnard/status/253009493049360384\">positively affectionate</a>.&nbsp;She has kind words for some Democrats (such as Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner), but offers blistering criticism of others (Robert Rubin, Tim Geithner and Larry Summers in particular). Among Republicans too, she is discerning: Bob Corker's efforts on financial reform are lauded, but the \"deregulatory dogma\" overseen by Alan Greenspan comes under forceful attack. She laments the \"disdain\" for government and its \"regulatory function\" and describes as a \"delusion\" the idea that markets are self-regulating. These are not the views of a political partisan.<br /><br />On policy, Bair is opposed to the use of derivatives for two-sided speculation (when neither party is hedging) and would require an insurable interest for the purchase of protection against default. She describes synthetic CDOs and naked CDSs as \"a game of fantasy football\" with no limit to the size of wagers that can be placed. She wants a \"lifetime ban on regulators working for financial institutions they have regulated.\" And she argues, as did James Tobin <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.in/2010/05/james-tobins-hirsch-lecture.html\">a generation ago</a>, that the attraction of the financial sector for some of the best and brightest of our youth is detrimental to long term economic growth and prosperity.<br /><br />No review of this book would be complete without mention of the bailouts, which troubled Bair from the outset, and which she now feels were excessive:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To this day, I wonder if we overreacted... Yes, action had to be taken, but the generosity of the response still troubles me... Granted, we were dealing with an emergency and had to act quickly. And the actions did stave off a broader financial crisis. But the unfairness of it and the lack of hard analysis showing the necessity of it trouble me to this day. The mere fact that a bunch of large financial institutions is going to lose money does not a systemic event make... Throughout the crisis and its aftermath, the smaller banks - which didn't benefit at all from government largesse - did a much better job of lending than the big institutions did.&nbsp;</blockquote>What bothers her most of all is the claim that the bailouts were justified because they made an accounting profit:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The thing I hate hearing most when people talk about the crisis is that the bailouts \"saved the system\" or ended up \"making money.\" Participating in bailout measures was the most distasteful thing I have ever had to do, and those ex post facto rationalizations make my skin crawl... The bailouts, while stabilizing the financial system in the short term, have created a long-term drag on our economy. Because we propped up the mismanaged institutions, our financial sector remains bloated... We did not force financial institutions to shed their bad assets and recognize their losses... Economic growth is sluggish, unemployment remains high. The housing market still struggles. I hope that our economy continues to improve. But it will do so despite the bailouts, not because of them.</blockquote>The ideal policy, according to Bair, would have been to put insolvent institutions into the \"bankruptcy-like resolution process\" used routinely by the FDIC, but she recognizes that the legal basis for doing so was not available at the time. She therefore signed on to measures that were instinctively repugnant to her, and tried to corral and contain them to the extent possible.<br /><br />The argument that the bailouts \"made money\" is specious for two reasons. First, the funds provided were given well below market value, and the cost to taxpayers should be computed relative to the value of the service provided. If insurance is provided at a fraction of the actuarially fair price, and no claim is made over the period of insurance (so the insurer makes money), this does not mean that there was no subsidy in the first place. Steve Waldman has made this point <a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2587.html\">very effectively</a>&nbsp;in the past.&nbsp;Furthermore, the cost to taxpayers should take into account any loss of revenues from more sluggish growth. If Bair is right to argue that the bailouts were excessively generous, to the point that growth prospects were damaged for an extended period, the loss of tax revenue must be included in any assessment of the cost of the bailout.<br /><br />As noted above, there are many accounts in the book of meetings and decisions, and a number of speculative inferences about the actions and intentions of others. Some of these will be <a href=\"http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2012/10/01/book_reviiew_sheila_bairs_bull_by_the_horns_99906.html\">hotly disputed</a>.

But reading it again I realized that it contains a perspective on&nbsp;market efficiency and price discovery that is concise, penetrating and worthy of some elaboration. Kay doesn't just provide a critique of the efficient markets hypothesis; he sketches out an alternative approach based on the idea of prices as the \"product of a clash between competing narratives\" that&nbsp;can form the basis of an entire research agenda.<br /><br />He begins with a question famously posed by the Queen of England during a visit to the London School of Economics:&nbsp;Why had economists failed to predict the financial crisis? Robert Lucas&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/14165405\">pointed out</a> in response that&nbsp;the inability to predict a financial crisis was in fact a prediction of economic theory. This is as pure a distillation of the efficient markets hypothesis is one is likely to find, and Kay uses it to evaluate the hypothesis itself: <br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Lucas’s assertion that ‘no one could have predicted it’ contains an important, though partial, insight.  There can be no objective basis for a prediction of the kind ‘Lehman Bros will go into liquidation on September 15’, because if there were, people would act on that expectation and, most likely, Lehman would go into liquidation straight away.  The economic world, far more than the physical world, is influenced by our beliefs about it.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Such thinking leads, as Lucas explains, directly to the efficient market hypothesis – available knowledge is already incorporated in the price of securities.  And there is a substantial amount of truth in this – the growth prospects of Apple and Google, the problems of Greece and the Eurozone, are all reflected in the prices of shares, bonds and currencies.  The efficient market hypothesis is an illuminating idea, but it is not “Reality As It Is In Itself”.  Information is reflected in prices, but not necessarily accurately, or completely.  There are wide differences in understanding and belief, and different perceptions of a future that can be at best dimly perceived.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In his <i>Economist</i> response, Lucas acknowledges that ‘exceptions and anomalies’ to the efficient market hypothesis have been discovered, ‘but for the purposes of macroeconomic analyses and forecasts they are too small to matter’. But how could anyone know, in advance not just of this crisis but also of any future crisis, that exceptions and anomalies to the efficient market hypothesis are ‘too small to matter’? </blockquote>The literature on anomalies is not, in fact, concerned with <i>macroeconomic</i> analyses and forecasts. It is rather narrowly focused on predictability in asset prices and the possibility of constructing portfolios that can consistently beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis. And indeed, such anomalies are often found to be quite trivial, especially when one considers the costs of implementing the implied strategies. The inability of actively managed funds to beat the market on average, after accounting for costs and adjusting for risk, is often cited as providing empirical support for market efficiency. But Kay believes that these findings have not been properly interpreted:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">What Lucas means when he asserts that deviations are ‘too small to matter’ is that attempts to construct general models of deviations from the efficient market hypothesis – by specifying mechanical trading rules or by writing equations to identify bubbles in asset prices – have not met with much success. But this is to miss the point: the expert billiard player plays a nearly perfect game, but it is the imperfections of play between experts that determine the result. There is a – trivial – sense in which the deviations from efficient markets are too small to matter – and a more important sense in which these deviations are the principal thing that matters.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The claim that most profit opportunities in business or in securities markets have been taken is justified.&nbsp; But it is the search for the profit opportunities that have not been taken that drives business forward, the belief that profit opportunities that have not been arbitraged away still exist that explains why there is so much trade in securities. Far from being ‘too small to matter’, these deviations from efficient market assumptions, not necessarily large, are the dynamic of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Such anomalies are idiosyncratic and cannot, by their very nature, be derived as logical deductions from an axiomatic system. The distinguishing characteristic of Henry Ford or Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett or George Soros, is that their behaviour cannot be predicted from any prespecified model. If the behaviour of these individuals could be predicted in this way, they would not have been either innovative or rich. But the consequences are plainly not ‘too small to matter’.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The preposterous claim that deviations from market efficiency were not only irrelevant to the recent crisis but could never be relevant is the product of an environment in which deduction has driven out induction and ideology has taken over from observation. The belief that models are not just useful tools but also are capable of yielding comprehensive and universal descriptions of the world has blinded its proponents to realities that have been staring them in the face. That blindness was an element in our present crisis, and conditions our still ineffectual responses.&nbsp;</blockquote>Fair enough, but how should one proceed? Kay suggests the adoption of more&nbsp;\"eclectic analysis... not just deductive logic but also an understanding of processes of belief formation, anthropology, psychology and organisational behaviour, and meticulous observation of what people, businesses, and governments actually do.\"<br /><br />I have no quarrel with this prescription, but I'd also like to make a case for more creative and versatile deductive logic. One of the key modeling hypotheses in the economics of information is the so-called Harsanyi doctrine (or common prior assumption), which stipulates that all differences in beliefs ought to be modeled as if they arise from differences in information. This hypothesis <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591\">implies</a> that individuals can only disagree if such disagreement is not itself common knowledge: they cannot agree to disagree. It is not hard to see that such a hypothesis could not possibly allow for pure speculation on asset price movements, and hence cannot account for the large volume of trade in financial markets. In fact, it implies that order books in many markets would be empty, since a posted price would only be met by someone with superior information.<br /><br />The point is that over-reliance on deductive logic is not the only problem as far as financial modeling is concerned; the core assumptions to which deductive logic has been applied are themselves too restrictive. To my mind, the most interesting part of Kay's essay suggests how one might improve on this:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">You can learn a great deal about deviations from the efficient market hypothesis, and the role they played in the recent financial crisis, from journalistic descriptions by people like Michael Lewis and Greg Zuckerman, who describe the activities of some individuals who did predict it.  The large volume of such material that has appeared suggests many avenues of understanding that might be explored.  You could develop models in which some trading agents have incentives aligned with those of the investors who finance them and others do not.  You might describe how prices are the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world.  You might appreciate the natural human reactions that made it difficult to hold short positions when they returned losses quarter after quarter.</blockquote>There is definitely ongoing work in economics that explores many of these directions, some of which I have surveyed in <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/on-efficient-markets-and-coordination.html\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/01/john-geanakoplos-on-leverage-cycle.html\">posts</a>. But the idea of prices as&nbsp;<i>the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world</i> reminded me of a <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">paper</a> by Harrison and Kreps, which was one of the earliest models in finance to shed the common prior assumption.<br /><br />For anyone interested in developing models of heterogeneous beliefs in which trading occurs naturally over time, the Harrison-Kreps paper is the perfect place to start. They illustrate their model with an example that is easy to follow: a single asset provides title to a stream of dividend payments that may be either high or low, and investors disagree about the likelihood of transitions from high to low states and vice versa. This means that investors who value the asset most in one state differ from those who value it most in the other. Trading occurs as the asset is transferred across investors in the two different belief classes each time a transition to a different state occurs. The authors show that the price in <i>both</i> states is higher than it would be if investors were forced to hold the asset forever: there is a speculative premium that arises from the knowledge that someone else will, in due course and mistakenly in your opinion, value the asset more than you do.&nbsp;The contrast with the efficient markets hypothesis is striking and clear:<br /><blockquote>The basic tenet of fundamentalism, which goes back at least to J. B. Williams (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=lBROtwAACAAJ\">1938</a>), is that a stock has an intrinsic value related to the dividends it will pay, since a stock is a share in some enterprise and dividends represent the income that the enterprise gains for its owners. In one sense, we think that our analysis is consistent with the fundamentalist spirit, tempered by a subjectivist view of probability. Beginning with the view that stock prices are created by investors, and recognizing that investors may form different opinions even when they have the same substantive information, we contend that there can be no objective intrinsic value for the stock. Instead, we propose that the relevant notion of intrinsic value is obtained through market aggregation of diverse investor assessments. There are fundamentalist overtones in this position, since it is the market aggregation of investor attitudes and beliefs about future dividends with which we start. Under our assumptions, however, the aggregation process eventually yields prices with some curious characteristics. In particular, investors attach a higher value to ownership of the stock than they do to ownership of the dividend stream that it generates, which is not an immediately palatable conclusion from a fundamentalist point of view.</blockquote>The idea that prices are \"obtained through market aggregation of diverse investor assessments\" is not too far from Kay's more rhetorically powerful claim that they are \"the product of a clash between competing narratives\". &nbsp;What Harrison and Kreps do not consider is how diverse investor assessments change over time, since beliefs about transition probabilities are exogenously given in their analysis. But&nbsp;Kay's formulation suggests how progress on this front might be made. Beliefs change as some narratives gather influence relative to others, either though active persuasion (talking one's book for instance) or through differentials in profits accruing to those with different worldviews. While Kay is surely correct that a rich understanding of this process requires more than deductive reasoning, it is also true that deductive reasoning has not yet been pushed to its limits in facilitating our understanding of market dynamics.</div><br />" "http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/feeds/7034001661002955422/comments/default" (20523 40793) old 20 nil nil ((id nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4039434.post-7034001661002955422") (published nil "2012-08-15T05:21:00.000-04:00") (updated nil "2012-08-15T09:08:41.232-04:00") (title ((type .

"html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fourth anniversary of the Lehman bankruptcy has been selected as the release date for a <a href=\"http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/page15/WhatsTheUseofEconomics.html\">collection of essays</a>&nbsp;edited by Diane Coyle with the provocative title: What's the Use of Economics?&nbsp;The timing is impeccable and the question legitimate.<br /><br />The book collects together some very thoughtful responses by Andrew Haldane, John Kay, Wendy Carlin, Alan Kirman, Andrew Lo, Roger Farmer, and a host of other luminaries (the publishers were kind enough to send me an advance copy).&nbsp;There's enough material there for several posts but I'd like to start with the contribution by John Kay.<br /><br />This one, as it happens, has been <a href=\"http://www.johnkay.com/2011/10/04/the-map-is-not-the-territory-an-essay-on-the-state-of-economics\">published</a> before; I discussed Mike Woodford's reaction to it in a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2012/04/on-equilibrium-disequilibrium-and.html\">previous post</a>. But reading it again I realized that it contains a perspective on&nbsp;market efficiency and price discovery that is concise, penetrating and worthy of some elaboration. Kay doesn't just provide a critique of the efficient markets hypothesis; he sketches out an alternative approach based on the idea of prices as the \"product of a clash between competing narratives\" that&nbsp;can form the basis of an entire research agenda.<br /><br />He begins with a question famously posed by the Queen of England during a visit to the London School of Economics:&nbsp;Why had economists failed to predict the financial crisis? Robert Lucas&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/14165405\">pointed out</a> in response that&nbsp;the inability to predict a financial crisis was in fact a prediction of economic theory. This is as pure a distillation of the efficient markets hypothesis is one is likely to find, and Kay uses it to evaluate the hypothesis itself: <br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Lucas’s assertion that ‘no one could have predicted it’ contains an important, though partial, insight.  There can be no objective basis for a prediction of the kind ‘Lehman Bros will go into liquidation on September 15’, because if there were, people would act on that expectation and, most likely, Lehman would go into liquidation straight away.  The economic world, far more than the physical world, is influenced by our beliefs about it.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Such thinking leads, as Lucas explains, directly to the efficient market hypothesis – available knowledge is already incorporated in the price of securities.  And there is a substantial amount of truth in this – the growth prospects of Apple and Google, the problems of Greece and the Eurozone, are all reflected in the prices of shares, bonds and currencies.  The efficient market hypothesis is an illuminating idea, but it is not “Reality As It Is In Itself”.  Information is reflected in prices, but not necessarily accurately, or completely.  There are wide differences in understanding and belief, and different perceptions of a future that can be at best dimly perceived.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In his <i>Economist</i> response, Lucas acknowledges that ‘exceptions and anomalies’ to the efficient market hypothesis have been discovered, ‘but for the purposes of macroeconomic analyses and forecasts they are too small to matter’. But how could anyone know, in advance not just of this crisis but also of any future crisis, that exceptions and anomalies to the efficient market hypothesis are ‘too small to matter’? </blockquote>The literature on anomalies is not, in fact, concerned with <i>macroeconomic</i> analyses and forecasts. It is rather narrowly focused on predictability in asset prices and the possibility of constructing portfolios that can consistently beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis. And indeed, such anomalies are often found to be quite trivial, especially when one considers the costs of implementing the implied strategies. The inability of actively managed funds to beat the market on average, after accounting for costs and adjusting for risk, is often cited as providing empirical support for market efficiency. But Kay believes that these findings have not been properly interpreted:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">What Lucas means when he asserts that deviations are ‘too small to matter’ is that attempts to construct general models of deviations from the efficient market hypothesis – by specifying mechanical trading rules or by writing equations to identify bubbles in asset prices – have not met with much success. But this is to miss the point: the expert billiard player plays a nearly perfect game, but it is the imperfections of play between experts that determine the result. There is a – trivial – sense in which the deviations from efficient markets are too small to matter – and a more important sense in which these deviations are the principal thing that matters.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The claim that most profit opportunities in business or in securities markets have been taken is justified.&nbsp; But it is the search for the profit opportunities that have not been taken that drives business forward, the belief that profit opportunities that have not been arbitraged away still exist that explains why there is so much trade in securities. Far from being ‘too small to matter’, these deviations from efficient market assumptions, not necessarily large, are the dynamic of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Such anomalies are idiosyncratic and cannot, by their very nature, be derived as logical deductions from an axiomatic system. The distinguishing characteristic of Henry Ford or Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett or George Soros, is that their behaviour cannot be predicted from any prespecified model. If the behaviour of these individuals could be predicted in this way, they would not have been either innovative or rich. But the consequences are plainly not ‘too small to matter’.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The preposterous claim that deviations from market efficiency were not only irrelevant to the recent crisis but could never be relevant is the product of an environment in which deduction has driven out induction and ideology has taken over from observation. The belief that models are not just useful tools but also are capable of yielding comprehensive and universal descriptions of the world has blinded its proponents to realities that have been staring them in the face. That blindness was an element in our present crisis, and conditions our still ineffectual responses.&nbsp;</blockquote>Fair enough, but how should one proceed? Kay suggests the adoption of more&nbsp;\"eclectic analysis... not just deductive logic but also an understanding of processes of belief formation, anthropology, psychology and organisational behaviour, and meticulous observation of what people, businesses, and governments actually do.\"<br /><br />I have no quarrel with this prescription, but I'd also like to make a case for more creative and versatile deductive logic. One of the key modeling hypotheses in the economics of information is the so-called Harsanyi doctrine (or common prior assumption), which stipulates that all differences in beliefs ought to be modeled as if they arise from differences in information. This hypothesis <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591\">implies</a> that individuals can only disagree if such disagreement is not itself common knowledge: they cannot agree to disagree. It is not hard to see that such a hypothesis could not possibly allow for pure speculation on asset price movements, and hence cannot account for the large volume of trade in financial markets. In fact, it implies that order books in many markets would be empty, since a posted price would only be met by someone with superior information.<br /><br />The point is that over-reliance on deductive logic is not the only problem as far as financial modeling is concerned; the core assumptions to which deductive logic has been applied are themselves too restrictive. To my mind, the most interesting part of Kay's essay suggests how one might improve on this:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">You can learn a great deal about deviations from the efficient market hypothesis, and the role they played in the recent financial crisis, from journalistic descriptions by people like Michael Lewis and Greg Zuckerman, who describe the activities of some individuals who did predict it.  The large volume of such material that has appeared suggests many avenues of understanding that might be explored.  You could develop models in which some trading agents have incentives aligned with those of the investors who finance them and others do not.  You might describe how prices are the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world.  You might appreciate the natural human reactions that made it difficult to hold short positions when they returned losses quarter after quarter.</blockquote>There is definitely ongoing work in economics that explores many of these directions, some of which I have surveyed in <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/on-efficient-markets-and-coordination.html\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/01/john-geanakoplos-on-leverage-cycle.html\">posts</a>. But the idea of prices as&nbsp;<i>the product of a clash between competing narratives about the world</i> reminded me of a <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884166\">paper</a> by Harrison and Kreps, which was one of the earliest models in finance to shed the common prior assumption.<br /><br />For anyone interested in developing models of heterogeneous beliefs in which trading occurs naturally over time, the Harrison-Kreps paper is the perfect place to start. They illustrate their model with an example that is easy to follow: a single asset provides title to a stream of dividend payments that may be either high or low, and investors disagree about the likelihood of transitions from high to low states and vice versa. This means that investors who value the asset most in one state differ from those who value it most in the other. Trading occurs as the asset is transferred across investors in the two different belief classes each time a transition to a different state occurs. The authors show that the price in <i>both</i> states is higher than it would be if investors were forced to hold the asset forever: there is a speculative premium that arises from the knowledge that someone else will, in due course and mistakenly in your opinion, value the asset more than you do.&nbsp;The contrast with the efficient markets hypothesis is striking and clear:<br /><blockquote>The basic tenet of fundamentalism, which goes back at least to J. B. Williams (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=lBROtwAACAAJ\">1938</a>), is that a stock has an intrinsic value related to the dividends it will pay, since a stock is a share in some enterprise and dividends represent the income that the enterprise gains for its owners.

The Dow is a price-weighted index, and the average price of  its thirty components is currently around $58. Both Apple and Google  have share prices in excess of $600, and their inclusion would cause  day-to-day changes in the index to be driven largely by the behavior of  these two securities. For instance, their combined weight in the Dow  would be about 43% if they were to replace Alcoa and Travelers, which  are the two current components with the lowest valuations.

Under current conditions, a 1% change in the price of IBM  has an effect on the index that is almost seven times as great as a 1%  change in the price of Microsoft.

But as Prestbo and others have pointed out, the Dow provides an  uninterrupted picture of stock market movements dating back to 1896. An  abrupt switch to value weighting would introduce a methodological  discontinuity that would \"essentially obliterate this history.\"  Attention has therefore been focused on the desirability of a stock  split, which would reduce Apple's share price to a level that could be  accommodated by the questionable methodology of the Dow. <br /><br />But an abrupt switch to a value weighting or the flawed artifice of a  stock split are not the only available alternatives. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ssrn.com/abstract=2127890\">recent paper</a>&nbsp;we propose a modification  that largely preserves the historical integrity of the Dow time series,  while allowing for the inclusion of securities regardless of their  market price.

One of these maintains  continuity in the value of the index, while the other ensures that the  two subindices are weighted in proportion to their respective market  capitalizations. Stock splits require a change in parameters (as in the  case of the current Dow divisor) but only if the split occurs for a firm  in the price-weighted subindex. <br /><br />Once all incumbent firms are replaced, the result will be a fully  value-weighted index. In practice this could take several decades, as  some incumbent firms are likely to be remain components far into the  future. But firms in the price-weighted component of the index that  happen to have weights roughly commensurate with their market  capitalization can be transferred with no loss of continuity to the  value-weighted component.

Currently Coca Cola and Disney are prime  candidates for bridging. <br /><br />Under our proposed index, Apple would enter with a weight of less than  13% if it were to replace Alcoa. This is scarcely more than the weight  currently associated with IBM, a substantially smaller company.

The price of a contract that pays $10 if Rice is selected as Romney's running mate (and nothing otherwise) shot up from about 35 cents to $2, with about 2500 contracts changing hands within twenty minutes of the Drudge announcement. By the sleepy standards of the prediction market this constitutes very heavy volume.

For instance, the Republican VP Nominee market contains not just the contract for Rice, but also for 56 other potential candidates, as well as a residual contract that pays off if none of the named contracts do. The sum of the bids for all these contracts cannot exceed $10, otherwise someone could sell the entire set of contracts and make an arbitrage profit.

The sharp rise in the Rice contract caused the arbitrage condition to be momentarily violated and&nbsp;simultaneous sales of the entire set of contracts began to occur.

But as new bidders appeared for these other contracts the Rice contract itself was pushed back in price, resulting in the reversal seen in the above chart.

The price of a contract that pays $10 if Rice is selected as Romney's running mate (and nothing otherwise) shot up from about 35 cents to $2, with about 2500 contracts changing hands within twenty minutes of the Drudge announcement. By the sleepy standards of the prediction market this constitutes very heavy volume. Nate Silver&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fivethirtyeight/status/223564648216133632\">responded</a>&nbsp;at 7:49 as follows:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The Condi Rice for VP contract at Intrade possibly the most obvious short since <a href=\"http://t.co/2fy0Aw0v\">Pets.com</a></blockquote>Good advice, as it turned out.

We have the same human capital, the same physical capital, the same natural capital, the same knowledge... the same creativity... we have all these strengths, they haven't disappeared. What has happened is, <i>we're having a fight over claims, claims to resources</i>. We've created more liabilities... but these are just paper. Liabilities are claims on these resources. But the resources are﻿ there. <i>And the fight over the claims is interfering with our use of the resources</i>.&nbsp;</blockquote>I think this is a very useful way to think about the potential effectiveness under current conditions of various policy proposals, including conventional fiscal and monetary stabilization policies.<br /><br />Part of the reason for our anemic and fitful recovery is that contested claims, especially in the housing market, continue to be settled in a chaotic and extremely wasteful manner. Recovery from subprime foreclosures is typically a small fraction of outstanding principal, and properly calibrated <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">principal write-downs</a> can often benefit <i>both</i> borrowers and lenders. Modifications that would occur routinely under the traditional bilateral model of lending are much harder to implement when lenders are holders of complex structured claims on the revenues generated by mortgage payments. Direct contact between lenders and borrowers is neither legal nor practicable in this case, and the power to make modifications lies instead with servicers. But servicer incentives are not properly aligned with those of the lenders on whose behalf they collect and process payments. The result is foreclosure even when modification would be much less destructive of resources.<br /><br />Despite some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2012/06/home-sales-reports-what-matters.html\">indications</a>&nbsp;that home values are starting to rise again, the steady flow of <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-foreclosure-starts-2012-6\">defaults and foreclosures</a>&nbsp;shows no sign of abating. Any policy that stands a chance of getting us back to pre-recession levels of resource utilization has to result in the quick and orderly settlement of these claims, with or without modification of the original contractual terms. And it's not clear to me that the blunt instruments of conventional stabilization policy can accomplish this.<br /><br />Consider monetary policy for instance. The clamor for more aggressive action by the Fed has recently become deafening, with a long and distinguished line of advocates (see, for instance, recent posts by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/26167477428/future-heroes-of-humanity-and-heroes-of-japan\">Miles Kimball</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2012/06/guest_contribut_18.html\">Joseph Gagnon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/06/monetary-policy-1\">Ryan Avent</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=15095\">Scott Sumner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/opinion/krugman-the-great-abdication.html\">Paul Krugman</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2012/06/where-to-next.html\">Tim Duy</a>). While the various proposals differ with respect to details the idea seems to be the following: (i) the Fed has the capacity to increase inflation and nominal GDP should it choose to do so, (ii) this can be accomplished by asset purchases on a large enough scale, and (iii) doing this would increase not only inflation and nominal GDP but also output and employment.<br /><br />It's the third part of this argument with which I have some difficulty, because I don't see how it would help resolve the fight over claims that is crippling our recovery.&nbsp;Higher inflation can certainly reduce the real value of outstanding debt in an accounting sense, but this doesn't mean that distressed borrowers will be able to meet their obligations at the originally contracted terms. In order for them to do so, it is necessary that&nbsp;<i>their</i> nominal income rises, not just nominal income in the aggregate. And monetary policy via asset purchases would seem to put money disproportionately in the pockets of existing asset holders, who are more likely to be creditors than debtors. Put differently, while the Fed has the capacity to raise nominal income, it does not have much control over the manner in which this increment is distributed across the population. And the distribution matters.<br /><br />Similar issues arise with inflation.&nbsp;Inflation is just the growth rate of an index number, a weighted average of prices for a broad range of goods and services.&nbsp;The Fed can certainly raise the growth rate of this average, but has virtually no control over its individual components. That is, it cannot increase the inflation rate without simultaneously affecting <i>relative</i> prices. For instance,&nbsp;purchases of assets that drive down long term interest rates&nbsp;will lead to portfolio shifts and an increase in the price of commodities, which are now an actively traded asset class. This in turn will raise input costs for some firms more than others, and these cost increases will affect wages and prices to varying degrees depending on competitive conditions. As Dan Alpert has <a href=\"http://www.economonitor.com/danalperts2cents/2012/04/25/earth-to-paul-krugman/\">argued</a>,&nbsp;expansionary monetary policy under these conditions could even \"collapse economic activity, as limited per capita wages are shunted to oil and food, rather than to more expansionary forms of consumption.\"<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest that more aggressive action by the Fed is unwarranted or would necessarily be counterproductive, just that it needs to be supplemented by policies designed to secure the&nbsp;rapid and efficient settlement of conflicting claims.<br /><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">One of the most interesting proposals of this kind was&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html\">floated</a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;back in October 2008 by&nbsp;John Geanakoplos and Susan Koniak, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html\">second article</a> a few months later expanded on the original. It's worth examining the idea in detail. First,</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">deadweight losses</a> arising from foreclosure are substantial:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For subprime and other non-prime loans, which account for more than half of all foreclosures, the best thing to do for the homeowners and for the bondholders is to write down principal far enough so that each homeowner will have equity in his house and thus an incentive to pay and not default again down the line...&nbsp;there is room to make generous principal reductions, without hurting bondholders and without spending a dime of taxpayer money, because the bond markets expect so little out of foreclosures. Typically, a homeowner fights off eviction for 18 months, making no mortgage or tax payments and no repairs. Abandoned homes are often stripped and vandalized. Foreclosure and reselling expenses are so high the subprime bond market trades now as if it expects only 25 percent back on a loan when there is a foreclosure.</blockquote>Second, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">securitization</a> precludes direct contact between borrowers and lenders:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In the old days, a mortgage loan involved only two parties, a borrower and a bank. If the borrower ran into difficulty, it was in the bank’s interest to ease the homeowner’s burden and adjust the terms of the loan. When housing prices fell drastically, bankers renegotiated, helping to stabilize the market.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The world of securitization changed that, especially for subprime mortgages. There is no longer any equivalent of “the bank” that has an incentive to rework failing loans. The loans are pooled together, and the pooled mortgage payments are divided up among many securities according to complicated rules. A party called a “master servicer” manages the pools of loans. The security holders are effectively the lenders, but legally they are prohibited from contacting the homeowners.</blockquote>Third, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">incentives</a> of servicers are not aligned with those of lenders:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Why are the master servicers not doing what an old-fashioned banker would do? Because a servicer has very different incentives. Most anything a master servicer does to rework a loan will create big winners but also some big losers among the security holders to whom the servicer holds equal duties... By allowing foreclosures to proceed without much intervention, they avoid potentially huge lawsuits by injured security holders.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">On top of the legal risks, reworking loans can be costly for master servicers. They need to document what new monthly payment a homeowner can afford and assess fluctuating property values to determine whether foreclosing would yield more or less than reworking. It’s costly just to track down the distressed homeowners, who are understandably inclined to ignore calls from master servicers that they sense may be all too eager to foreclose.</blockquote>And finally, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">proposed solution</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To solve this problem, we propose legislation that moves the reworking function from the paralyzed master servicers and transfers it to community-based, government-appointed trustees. These trustees would be given no information about which securities are derived from which mortgages, or how those securities would be affected by the reworking and foreclosure decisions they make.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Instead of worrying about which securities might be harmed, the blind trustees would consider, loan by loan, whether a reworking would bring in more money than a foreclosure... The trustees would be hired from the ranks of community bankers, and thus have the expertise the judiciary lacks...&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our plan does not require that the loans be reassembled from the securities in which they are now divided, nor does it require the buying up of any loans or securities. It does require the transfer of the servicers’ duty to rework loans to government trustees. It requires that restrictions in some servicing contracts, like those on how many loans can be reworked in each pool, be eliminated when the duty to rework is transferred to the trustees...&nbsp;Once the trustees have examined the loans — leaving some unchanged, reworking others and recommending foreclosure on the rest — they would pass those decisions to the government clearing house for transmittal back to the appropriate servicers...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our plan would keep many more Americans in their homes, and put government money into local communities where it would make a difference. By clarifying the true value of each loan, it would also help clarify the value of securities associated with those mortgages, enabling investors to trade them again. Most important, our plan would help stabilize housing prices.</blockquote>As with any proposal dealing with a problem of such magnitude and complexity, there are downsides to this. Anticipation of modification could induce borrowers who are underwater but current with their payments to default strategically in order to secure reductions in principal. Such policy-induced default could be mitigated by ensuring that only truly distressed households qualify. But since current financial distress is in part a reflection of past decisions regarding consumption and saving, some are sure to find the distributional effects of the policy galling.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it seems that something along these lines needs to be attempted if we are to get back to pre-recession levels of resource utilization anytime soon.

"text")) "Fighting over Claims") (content ((type . "html")) "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This brief <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqFaZUOhhw\">segment</a> from a recent speech by Joe Stiglitz sums up very neatly the nature of our current economic predicament (emphasis added):<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">We should realize that the resources in our economy... today is the same is at was five years ago. We have the same human capital, the same physical capital, the same natural capital, the same knowledge... the same creativity... we have all these strengths, they haven't disappeared. What has happened is, <i>we're having a fight over claims, claims to resources</i>. We've created more liabilities... but these are just paper. Liabilities are claims on these resources. But the resources are﻿ there. <i>And the fight over the claims is interfering with our use of the resources</i>.&nbsp;</blockquote>I think this is a very useful way to think about the potential effectiveness under current conditions of various policy proposals, including conventional fiscal and monetary stabilization policies.<br /><br />Part of the reason for our anemic and fitful recovery is that contested claims, especially in the housing market, continue to be settled in a chaotic and extremely wasteful manner. Recovery from subprime foreclosures is typically a small fraction of outstanding principal, and properly calibrated <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">principal write-downs</a> can often benefit <i>both</i> borrowers and lenders. Modifications that would occur routinely under the traditional bilateral model of lending are much harder to implement when lenders are holders of complex structured claims on the revenues generated by mortgage payments. Direct contact between lenders and borrowers is neither legal nor practicable in this case, and the power to make modifications lies instead with servicers. But servicer incentives are not properly aligned with those of the lenders on whose behalf they collect and process payments. The result is foreclosure even when modification would be much less destructive of resources.<br /><br />Despite some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2012/06/home-sales-reports-what-matters.html\">indications</a>&nbsp;that home values are starting to rise again, the steady flow of <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-foreclosure-starts-2012-6\">defaults and foreclosures</a>&nbsp;shows no sign of abating. Any policy that stands a chance of getting us back to pre-recession levels of resource utilization has to result in the quick and orderly settlement of these claims, with or without modification of the original contractual terms. And it's not clear to me that the blunt instruments of conventional stabilization policy can accomplish this.<br /><br />Consider monetary policy for instance. The clamor for more aggressive action by the Fed has recently become deafening, with a long and distinguished line of advocates (see, for instance, recent posts by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/26167477428/future-heroes-of-humanity-and-heroes-of-japan\">Miles Kimball</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2012/06/guest_contribut_18.html\">Joseph Gagnon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/06/monetary-policy-1\">Ryan Avent</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=15095\">Scott Sumner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/opinion/krugman-the-great-abdication.html\">Paul Krugman</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2012/06/where-to-next.html\">Tim Duy</a>). While the various proposals differ with respect to details the idea seems to be the following: (i) the Fed has the capacity to increase inflation and nominal GDP should it choose to do so, (ii) this can be accomplished by asset purchases on a large enough scale, and (iii) doing this would increase not only inflation and nominal GDP but also output and employment.<br /><br />It's the third part of this argument with which I have some difficulty, because I don't see how it would help resolve the fight over claims that is crippling our recovery.&nbsp;Higher inflation can certainly reduce the real value of outstanding debt in an accounting sense, but this doesn't mean that distressed borrowers will be able to meet their obligations at the originally contracted terms. In order for them to do so, it is necessary that&nbsp;<i>their</i> nominal income rises, not just nominal income in the aggregate. And monetary policy via asset purchases would seem to put money disproportionately in the pockets of existing asset holders, who are more likely to be creditors than debtors. Put differently, while the Fed has the capacity to raise nominal income, it does not have much control over the manner in which this increment is distributed across the population. And the distribution matters.<br /><br />Similar issues arise with inflation.&nbsp;Inflation is just the growth rate of an index number, a weighted average of prices for a broad range of goods and services.&nbsp;The Fed can certainly raise the growth rate of this average, but has virtually no control over its individual components. That is, it cannot increase the inflation rate without simultaneously affecting <i>relative</i> prices. For instance,&nbsp;purchases of assets that drive down long term interest rates&nbsp;will lead to portfolio shifts and an increase in the price of commodities, which are now an actively traded asset class. This in turn will raise input costs for some firms more than others, and these cost increases will affect wages and prices to varying degrees depending on competitive conditions. As Dan Alpert has <a href=\"http://www.economonitor.com/danalperts2cents/2012/04/25/earth-to-paul-krugman/\">argued</a>,&nbsp;expansionary monetary policy under these conditions could even \"collapse economic activity, as limited per capita wages are shunted to oil and food, rather than to more expansionary forms of consumption.\"<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest that more aggressive action by the Fed is unwarranted or would necessarily be counterproductive, just that it needs to be supplemented by policies designed to secure the&nbsp;rapid and efficient settlement of conflicting claims.<br /><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">One of the most interesting proposals of this kind was&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html\">floated</a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;back in October 2008 by&nbsp;John Geanakoplos and Susan Koniak, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html\">second article</a> a few months later expanded on the original. It's worth examining the idea in detail. First,</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05geanokoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">deadweight losses</a> arising from foreclosure are substantial:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">For subprime and other non-prime loans, which account for more than half of all foreclosures, the best thing to do for the homeowners and for the bondholders is to write down principal far enough so that each homeowner will have equity in his house and thus an incentive to pay and not default again down the line...&nbsp;there is room to make generous principal reductions, without hurting bondholders and without spending a dime of taxpayer money, because the bond markets expect so little out of foreclosures. Typically, a homeowner fights off eviction for 18 months, making no mortgage or tax payments and no repairs. Abandoned homes are often stripped and vandalized. Foreclosure and reselling expenses are so high the subprime bond market trades now as if it expects only 25 percent back on a loan when there is a foreclosure.</blockquote>Second, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">securitization</a> precludes direct contact between borrowers and lenders:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">In the old days, a mortgage loan involved only two parties, a borrower and a bank. If the borrower ran into difficulty, it was in the bank’s interest to ease the homeowner’s burden and adjust the terms of the loan. When housing prices fell drastically, bankers renegotiated, helping to stabilize the market.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The world of securitization changed that, especially for subprime mortgages. There is no longer any equivalent of “the bank” that has an incentive to rework failing loans. The loans are pooled together, and the pooled mortgage payments are divided up among many securities according to complicated rules. A party called a “master servicer” manages the pools of loans. The security holders are effectively the lenders, but legally they are prohibited from contacting the homeowners.</blockquote>Third, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">incentives</a> of servicers are not aligned with those of lenders:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Why are the master servicers not doing what an old-fashioned banker would do? Because a servicer has very different incentives. Most anything a master servicer does to rework a loan will create big winners but also some big losers among the security holders to whom the servicer holds equal duties... By allowing foreclosures to proceed without much intervention, they avoid potentially huge lawsuits by injured security holders.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">On top of the legal risks, reworking loans can be costly for master servicers. They need to document what new monthly payment a homeowner can afford and assess fluctuating property values to determine whether foreclosing would yield more or less than reworking. It’s costly just to track down the distressed homeowners, who are understandably inclined to ignore calls from master servicers that they sense may be all too eager to foreclose.</blockquote>And finally, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30geanakoplos.html?pagewanted=all\">proposed solution</a>:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">To solve this problem, we propose legislation that moves the reworking function from the paralyzed master servicers and transfers it to community-based, government-appointed trustees. These trustees would be given no information about which securities are derived from which mortgages, or how those securities would be affected by the reworking and foreclosure decisions they make.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Instead of worrying about which securities might be harmed, the blind trustees would consider, loan by loan, whether a reworking would bring in more money than a foreclosure... The trustees would be hired from the ranks of community bankers, and thus have the expertise the judiciary lacks...&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our plan does not require that the loans be reassembled from the securities in which they are now divided, nor does it require the buying up of any loans or securities. It does require the transfer of the servicers’ duty to rework loans to government trustees. It requires that restrictions in some servicing contracts, like those on how many loans can be reworked in each pool, be eliminated when the duty to rework is transferred to the trustees...&nbsp;Once the trustees have examined the loans — leaving some unchanged, reworking others and recommending foreclosure on the rest — they would pass those decisions to the government clearing house for transmittal back to the appropriate servicers...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Our plan would keep many more Americans in their homes, and put government money into local communities where it would make a difference. By clarifying the true value of each loan, it would also help clarify the value of securities associated with those mortgages, enabling investors to trade them again. Most important, our plan would help stabilize housing prices.</blockquote>As with any proposal dealing with a problem of such magnitude and complexity, there are downsides to this. Anticipation of modification could induce borrowers who are underwater but current with their payments to default strategically in order to secure reductions in principal. Such policy-induced default could be mitigated by ensuring that only truly distressed households qualify. But since current financial distress is in part a reflection of past decisions regarding consumption and saving, some are sure to find the distributional effects of the policy galling.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it seems that something along these lines needs to be attempted if we are to get back to pre-recession levels of resource utilization anytime soon. And the urgency of action does seem to be&nbsp;getting&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/business/economy/real-estates-collective-action-problem.html\">renewed attention</a>.<br /><br />The bottom line, I think, is this: too much faith in the traditional tools of macroeconomic stabilization under current conditions is misplaced. One can conceive of dramatically different approaches to monetary policy, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/918.html\">direct</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/\">transfers</a>&nbsp;to households, but these would surely face insurmountable legal and political obstacles. It is essential, therefore, that macroeconomic stabilization be supplemented by policies that&nbsp;are microeconomically detailed, fine grained, and directly confront the problem of balance sheet repair.

I met her just once, after a talk she gave at Columbia sometime in the 1990s. It was in a very interesting seminar series organized by Dick Nelson if I recall correctly.<br /><br />I was a great admirer of Ostrom's research on common pool resources, and tried to interpret some of her insights from an evolutionary perspective in some <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2118304\">joint work</a> with E. Somanathan a while ago. I've written about her here on a couple of occasions, and once reviewed a <a href=\"http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=10728\">book</a>&nbsp;that was largely a celebration of her vision (she had a hand in no less than six chapters).<br /><br />Here are some extracts from a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/choice-of-elinor-ostrom-as-co-recipient.html\">post</a> written soon after the Nobel announcement:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Ostrom’s extensive research on local governance has shattered the myth of inevitability surrounding the “tragedy of the commons” and curtailed the uncritical application of the free-rider hypothesis to collective action problems. Prior to her work it was widely believed that scarce natural resources such as forests and fisheries would be wastefully used and degraded or exhausted under common ownership, and therefore had to be either state owned or held as private property in order to be efficiently managed. Ostrom demonstrated that self-governance was possible when a group of users had collective rights to the resource, including the right to exclude outsiders, and the capacity to enforce rules and norms through a system of decentralized monitoring and sanctions. This is clearly a finding of considerable practical significance.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">As importantly, the award recognized an approach to research that is practically extinct in contemporary economics. Ostrom developed her ideas by reading and generalizing from a vast number of case studies of forests, fisheries, groundwater basins, irrigation systems, and pastures.  Her work is rich in institutional detail and interdisciplinary to the core. She used game theoretic models and laboratory experiments to refine her ideas, but historical and institutional analysis was central to this effort.

I met her just once, after a talk she gave at Columbia sometime in the 1990s. It was in a very interesting seminar series organized by Dick Nelson if I recall correctly.<br /><br />I was a great admirer of Ostrom's research on common pool resources, and tried to interpret some of her insights from an evolutionary perspective in some <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2118304\">joint work</a> with E. Somanathan a while ago. I've written about her here on a couple of occasions, and once reviewed a <a href=\"http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=10728\">book</a>&nbsp;that was largely a celebration of her vision (she had a hand in no less than six chapters).<br /><br />Here are some extracts from a <a href=\"http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2009/11/choice-of-elinor-ostrom-as-co-recipient.html\">post</a> written soon after the Nobel announcement:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Ostrom’s extensive research on local governance has shattered the myth of inevitability surrounding the “tragedy of the commons” and curtailed the uncritical application of the free-rider hypothesis to collective action problems. Prior to her work it was widely believed that scarce natural resources such as forests and fisheries would be wastefully used and degraded or exhausted under common ownership, and therefore had to be either state owned or held as private property in order to be efficiently managed. Ostrom demonstrated that self-governance was possible when a group of users had collective rights to the resource, including the right to exclude outsiders, and the capacity to enforce rules and norms through a system of decentralized monitoring and sanctions. This is clearly a finding of considerable practical significance.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">As importantly, the award recognized an approach to research that is practically extinct in contemporary economics. Ostrom developed her ideas by reading and generalizing from a vast number of case studies of forests, fisheries, groundwater basins, irrigation systems, and pastures.  Her work is rich in institutional detail and interdisciplinary to the core. She used game theoretic models and laboratory experiments to refine her ideas, but historical and institutional analysis was central to this effort.  She deviated from standard economic assumptions about rationality and self-interest when she felt that such assumptions were at variance with observed behavior, and did so long before behavioral economics was in fashion...&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">There is no doubt that her research has dramatically transformed our thinking about the feasibility and efficiency of common property regimes.
