Evidence and illustration in the social sciences,&#8221; Thomas Basbøll and I <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/Storytelling_as_Ideology_13.pdf\">write</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Storytelling has long been recognized as central to human cognition and communication. Here we explore a more active role of stories in social science research, not merely to illustrate concepts but also to develop new ideas and evaluate hypotheses, for example in deciding that a research method is effective. We see stories as central to engagement with the development and evaluation of theories, and we argue that for a story to be useful in this way, it should be <em>anomalous</em> (representing aspects of life that are not well explained by existing models) and <em>immutable</em> (with details that are well-enough established that they have the potential to indicate problems with a new model).</p></blockquote><p>We draw a connection to posterior predictive checking, which I earlier had argued is fundamentally connected with statistical graphics and exploratory data analysis (see <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/isr.pdf\">this paper</a> from 2003 and <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/p755.pdf\">this</a> one 2004).</p><p>I don&#8217;t have anything more to say on this right now.  I just wanted to juxtapose these two perspectives, each of which connect statistical graphics to literature, but in a different way.  Kosara focuses on the idea that stories have narrative and viewpoint, and Basbøll and I focus on the idea that effective stories are anomalous and immutable.  All these ideas seem important to me, and it would be interesting to think about how they fit together.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/07/literature-like-statistical-reasoning-kosara-stories-gelman-basboll-stories/\">How literature is like statistical reasoning:  Kosara on stories.

I live in a rich country, this person lives in a poor country so he wants to come here.  The success rate of any pitch is approximately N*p, so I assume he&#8217;s going for the traditional spam plan and maximizing N.  He has access to a long list of emails of math, stat, econ, and engineering professors in the First World and he&#8217;s sending this message to all of us.  Finally, he is demonstrating his access to computing skills by stripping out an article with my name on it.  But I don&#8217;t think this particular student wrote the software to do this.  I get so much of this sort of spam that I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s a free or pirated program do do this strip-cut-and-paste action.</p><p>What amazes me is that these spammers seem uniformly to pick the most inappropriate of my articles for these pitches.  Always, it seems, they&#8217;ll pick a discussion or a comment or an article on the history of statistics or something else that&#8217;s not really so close to my most active research.  Maybe it&#8217;s something about the program they use to grab an article title?  Maybe it purposely takes the title of an article with very few citations on the theory that I&#8217;ll be impressed that the student &#8220;went through&#8221; something obscure?</p><p>The whole situation just makes me feel sad.

Publish or die? “Interesting” and “new” above quality and reliability, or actually answering a research question, and a silly and unbecoming obsession with being quoted in NYT, etc. . . . Given the incentives something silly is bound to happen. At issue is cause or effect.</p><p>At this point I was going to respond in the comments, but I decided to make this a separate post (at the cost of pre-empting yet another scheduled item on the queue), for two reasons:</p><p>1.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot fewer people read the comments than read the posts; and</p><p>2.  I thought of this great title (see above) and I wanted to use it.</p><p><strong>First let&#8217;s get Bayes out of the way</strong></p><p>Just to start with, none of this is a Bayes vs. non-Bayes battle.  I hate those battles, partly because we sometimes end up with the sort of the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend sort of reasoning that leads smart, skeptical people who should know better to defend all sorts of bad practices with p-values, just because they (the smart skeptics) are wary of overarching Bayesian arguments.  I think Bayesian methods are great, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but the discussion here has little to do with Bayes.  Null hypothesis significance testing can be done in a non-Bayesian way (of course, just see all sorts of theoretical-statistics textbooks) but some Bayesians like to do it too, using Bayes factors and all the rest of that crap to decide whether to accept models of the theta=0 variety.  Do it using p-values or Bayes factors, either way it&#8217;s significance testing with the goal of rejecting models.</p><p><strong>The Notorious N.H.S.T. as an enabler</strong></p><p>I agree with the now-conventional wisdom expressed by the original commenter, that null hypothesis significance testing is generally inappropriate.  But I also agree with Fernando&#8217;s comment that the pressures of publication would be leading to the aggressive dissemination of noise, in any case.  What I think is that the notorious N.H.S.T. is part of the problem.  It&#8217;s a mechanism by which noise can be spread.  This relates to my recent discussion with Steven Pinker (not published on blog yet, it&#8217;s on the queue, you&#8217;ll see it in a month or so).</p><p>To say it another way, the reason why I go on and on about multiple comparisons is not that I think it&#8217;s so important to get correct p-values, but rather that these p-values are being used as the statistical justification for otherwise laughable claims.</p><p>I agree with Fernando that, if it wasn&#8217;t N.H.S.T., some other tool would be used to give the stamp of approval on data-based speculations.  But null hypothesis testing is what&#8217;s being used now, so I think it&#8217;s important to continue to point out <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/06/much-time-spend-criticizing-research-thats-fraudulent-crappy-just-plain-pointless/\">the confusion between research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses</a>, and the fallacy of, as the commenter put it, &#8220;disproving always false null hypotheses and taking this disproof as near proof that their theory is correct.&#8221;</p><p>P.S.  &#8220;The aggressive dissemination of noise&#8221; . . .

Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.</p><p>And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man&#8212;Thomas Arena&#8212;who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .</p><p>These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan&#8217;s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.</p></blockquote><p>Brooks is reputed to be Jewish himself so I think it&#8217;s ok for him to mock Jewish people in print.  The urologist bit . . . well, hey, I&#8217;m <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/09/05/two-exciting-movie-ideas-second-chance-u-and-the-new-dirty-dozen/#comment-99297\">not above</a> a bit of bathroom humor myself&#8212;and nor, for that matter, is the great Dave Barry&#8212;so I can hardly fault a columnist for finding a laugh where he can.</p><p>The interesting part, though, comes near the end of the column:</p><blockquote><p>The members of the cognitive elite will work their way up into law partnerships or top jobs at the New York Times, but they probably won&#8217;t enter the billionaire ranks. The real wealth will go to the risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in middle- or lower-middle-class homes and got no help from their non-professional parents when they went off to college.</p></blockquote><p>One of the fun things about revisiting old journalism is that we can check how the predictions come out.  So let&#8217;s examine the two claims above, 17 years later:</p><p>1.  &#8220;The members of the cognitive elite . . . probably won&#8217;t enter the billionaire ranks.&#8221;  Check.  No problem there.  Almost nobody is a billionaire, so, indeed, most people with graduate degrees who are featured in the NYT wedding section do not become billionaires.</p><p>2.  &#8220;The real wealth will go to the risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in middle- or lower-middle-class homes and got no help from their non-professional parents when they went off to college.&#8221;  Hmmm . . . I googled rich people and found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Forbes_400\">this</a> convenient wikipedia list of members of the Forbes 400.  Let&#8217;s go through them in order:</p><p>Bill Gates<br />
Warren Buffett<br />
Larry Ellison<br />
Charles Koch<br />
David H. Koch<br />
Christy Walton<br />
Jim Walton<br />
Alice Walton<br />
S. Robson Walton<br />
Michael Bloomberg<br />
Sheldon Adelson<br />
Jeff Bezos<br />
Larry Page<br />
Sergey Brin<br />
Forrest Mars, Jr.</p><p>Most of these had backgrounds far above the middle class.  For example, of Gates, &#8220;His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s Buffett:  &#8220;Buffett&#8217;s interest in the stock market and investing also dated to his childhood, to the days he spent in the customers&#8217; lounge of a regional stock brokerage near the office of his father&#8217;s own brokerage company.&#8221;  Koch:  &#8220;After college, Koch started work at Arthur D. Little, Inc. In 1961 he moved back to Wichita to join his father&#8217;s business, Rock Island Oil &#038; Refining Company.&#8221;  And I don&#8217;t think I have to tell you about the backgrounds of the Waltons or Forrest Mars, Jr.  Larry Page had more of a middle class background but not the kind that David Brooks was looking for:  &#8220;His father, Carl Page, earned a Ph.D. in computer science in . . . and is considered a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence. Both he and Page&#8217;s mother, Gloria, were computer science professors at Michigan State University.&#8221;  And here&#8217;s Sergei Brin:  &#8220;His father is a mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother a researcher at NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center.&#8221;  Damn!  Foiled again.  They might have even <em>really</em> violated Brooks&#8217;s rule and paid for Brin&#8217;s college education.</p><p>That leaves us with Larry Ellison, Sheldon Adelson, Michael Bloomberg, and Jeff Bezos:  4 out of the Forbes 15.  So, no, I think Brooks would&#8217;ve been more prescient had he written:</p><blockquote><p>The real wealth will go to the heirs of rich people or to risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in rich or upper-class homes or who grew up middle class but got lots of help from their well-educated professional parents when they went off to college and graduate school.</p></blockquote><p>But that wouldn&#8217;t have sounded as good.  It would&#8217;ve been like <a href=\"http://www.phillymag.com/articles/booboos-in-paradise/\">admitting</a> that the surf-and-turf at Red Lobster actually cost more than $20.  As Sasha Issenberg reported back in 2006:</p><blockquote><p>I went through some of the other instances where he [Brooks] made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being “too pedantic,” of “taking all of this too literally,” of “taking a joke and distorting it.” “That&#8217;s totally unethical,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>This time, let me make it clear that I&#8217;m not saying that Brooks did any false reporting. He just made a prediction in 1997 that was way way off.  I do think Brooks showed poor statistical or sociological judgment, though.  To think that &#8220;the real wealth&#8221; will go to the children of the &#8220;middle- or lower-middle-class&#8221; who don&#8217;t even pay for their college education . . . that&#8217;s just naiveté or wishful thinking at best or political propaganda at worst.</p><p>Brooks follows up his claim with this bizarre (to me) bit of opinionizing:</p><blockquote><p>The people on the New York Times wedding page won&#8217;t make $4 million a year like the guy who started a chain of erotic car washes. They&#8217;ll have to make do with, say, $1.2 million if they make partner of their law firms. Maybe even less. The cognitive elite have more status but less money than the millionaire entrepreneurs, and their choices as consumers reflect their unceasing desire to demonstrate their social superiority to people richer than themselves.</p></blockquote><p>I honestly can&#8217;t figure out what he&#8217;s getting at here except that I think it&#8217;s a bit of &#8220;mood affiliation,&#8221; as Tyler Cowen might say.  According to Brooks&#8217;s ideology (which he seems to have borrowed from Tom Wolfe), &#8220;the guy who started a chain of erotic car washes&#8221; is a good guy, and &#8220;the cognitive elite&#8221; are bad guys.  One way you can see this is that the erotic car wash guy is delightfully unpretentious (he might, for example have season tickets to the local football team and probably has a really big house and and a bunch of cars and boats, and he probably eats a lot of fat steaks too), while the cognitive elite have an &#8220;unceasing desire to demonstrate their social superiority.&#8221;  They&#8217;re probably Jewish, too, just like that unfortunate urologist from the first paragraph of Brooks&#8217;s article.</p><p>But the thing that puzzles me is . . . isn&#8217;t 1.2 million a year <em>enough</em>?  I mean, sure, if this car wash guy really wants more more more, then he can go for it, why not.  But it seems a bit rich to characterize a bigshot lawyer as being some sort of envious hater because he was satisfied to max out at only a million a year.  I mean, that&#8217;s just sad.  Really sad, if there are people out there who think they&#8217;re failures unless they make 4 million dollars a year.  There just aren&#8217;t that many slots in the world for people like that.  If you have that attitude, you&#8217;re doomed to failure, statistically speaking.</p><p><strong>Why bother?</strong></p><p>The question always comes up when I write about these political journalists:  why spend the time?  Wouldn&#8217;t the world be better off if I were to put the equivalent effort into Stan, or EP, or Waic, or APC, or MRP, or various other statistical ideas that can really help people out?</p><p>Even if you agree with me that David Brooks is misguided, does it really help for me to dredge up a 17-year-old column?  Better perhaps to let these things just sit, forgotten for another 17 years, perhaps.</p><p>My short and lazy answer is that I blog in part to let off steam.  Better for me to just express my annoyance (even if, as in this case, it took me an hour to look up all those Wiki pages and write the post) than have it fester in my mind, distracting me from more important tasks.</p><p>My longer answer is:  Red State Blue State.  I do think that statistical misunderstandings can lead to political confusion.  After all, if you really think that a good ticket for massive wealth is having lower-middle-class parents who won&#8217;t pay for college . . . well, that has some potential policy implications.  But if you go with the facts and look at who the richest Americans really are and where they came from, that&#8217;s a different story.</p><p>Also, more generally, I wish people would revisit their pasts and correct their mistakes.  I did it with <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2013/03/18/tibshirani-announces-new-research-result-a-significance-test-for-the-lasso/\">lasso</a> and I wish Brooks would do it here.  What a great topic for his next NYT column:  he could revisit this old article of his and explain where he went wrong, and how this could be a great learning experience.  A lesson in <a href=\"http://students.yale.edu/oci/resultDetail.jsp?course=23724&#038;term=201301\">humility</a>, as it were.</p><p>I&#8217;ll make a deal with David Brooks:  if you devote a column to this, I&#8217;ll devote a column to my false theorem&#8212;the paper my colleague and I published in 1993 that we had to retract because our so-called theorem was just wrong.  I mean wrong wrong wrong, as in someone sent us a counterexample.</p><p>But I doubt Brooks will take me up on his offer, as I don&#8217;t think he ever ran a column on his mistake regarding the prices at Red Lobster, nor did he ever retract the &#8220;potentially ground-shifting&#8221; but <a href=\"http://www.symposium-magazine.com/sorry-wrong-number-andrew-gelman/\">false</a> claims he publicized awhile ago in his column.</p><p>So, even though I would think it would be excellent form, and in Brooks&#8217;s best interests, to correct his past errors, he doesn&#8217;t seem to think so himself.  I find myself in the position of Albert Brooks in that famous scene in Lost in America in which he tries in vain to persuade the casino manager to give back all the money his wife just gambled away:  &#8220;As the boldest experiment in advertising history, you give us our money back.&#8221;</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/03/boldest-experiment-journalism-history-admit-made-mistake/\">As the boldest experiment in journalism history, you admit you made a mistake</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/03/boldest-experiment-journalism-history-admit-made-mistake/feed/") (slash:comments nil "51")) (item nil (title nil "Am I too negative?")

He said most papers are not worth reading and that he learned early on to concentrate on the great papers, maybe one in 500, that are worth reading and rereading rather than trying to “keep up with the literature.” He also explained how over time he has concentrated more on showcasing excellent work than on criticizing bad work. You can see this in the progression from his first book to his latest. (Criticizing bad work is important too, but you’ll have to read his early books to find more of that. He won’t spend as much time talking about it in his course.) That reminded me of Jesse Robbins’ line: “Don’t fight stupid. You are better than that. Make more awesome.”</p></blockquote><p>This made me stop and think, given how much time I spend criticizing things. Indeed, like Tufte I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time criticizing chartjunk!  I do think, though, that I and others have learned a lot from my criticisms. There’s some way in which good examples, as well as bad examples, can be helpful in developing and understanding general principles.</p><p>For example, consider graphics.  As a former physics major, I&#8217;ve always used graphs as a matter of course (originally using pencil on graph paper and then moving to computers), and eventually I published several papers on graphics that had constructive, positive messages:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/dodhia.pdf\">Let&#8217;s practice what we preach: turning tables into graphs</a> (with Cristian Pasarica and Rahul Dodhia)</p><p><a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/isr.pdf\">A Bayesian formulation of exploratory data analysis and goodness-of-fit testing</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/p755.pdf\">Exploratory data analysis for complex models</a></p><p>as well as many many applied papers in which graphical analysis was central to the process of scientific discovery (in particular, see <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/bjps1993.pdf\">this paper</a> (with Gary King) on why preelection polls are so variable and <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/democracy2.pdf\">this paper</a> (with Gary King) on the effects of redistricting.</p><p>The next phase of my writing on graphics accentuated the negative, with a series of blog posts over several years criticizing various published graphs.  I do think this criticism was generally constructive (a typical post might point to a recent research article and make some suggestions of how to display the data or inferences more clearly) but it certainly had a negative feel&#8212;to the extent that complete strangers started sending me bad graphs to mock on the blog.</p><p>This phase peaked with a <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2009/04/20/better_late_tha/\">post</a> of mine from 2009 (with followup <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2009/04/22/more_on_data_vi/\">here</a>), slamming some popular infographics.  These and subsequent posts sparked lots of discussion, and I was motivated to work with Antony Unwin and write the article that eventually became <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/vis14.pdf\">Infovis and statistical graphics: Different goals, different looks</a> and was published with discussion in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.  Between the initial post and the final appearance of the paper, my thinking changed, and I became much more clear on the idea that graphical displays have different sorts of goals.  And I don&#8217;t think I could&#8217;ve got there without starting with criticism.</p><p>(<a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2011/08/29/infovis-infographics-and-data-visualization-where-im-coming-from-and-where-id-like-to-go/\">Here&#8217;s a blog post from 2011</a> where I explain where I&#8217;m coming from on the graphics criticism.  See also <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2013/05/09/a-tale-of-two-discussion-papers/\">here</a> for a slightly broader discussion of the difficulties of communication across different research perspectives.)</p><p>A similar pattern seems to be occurring in my recent series of criticisms of &#8220;Psychological Science&#8221;-style research papers.  In this case, I&#8217;m part of an informal &#8220;club&#8221; of critics (Simonsohn, Francis, Ioannidis, Nosek, etc etc), but, again, it seems that criticism of bad work can be a helpful way of moving forward and thinking harder about how to do good work.</p><p>It’s funny, though. In my blog and in my talks, I talk about stuff I like and stuff I don’t like. But in my books, just about all my examples are positive. We have very few negative examples, really none at all that I can think of (except for some of the examples in the “lying with statistics” chapter in the Teaching Statistics book). This suggests that I’m doing something different in my books than in my blogs and lectures.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/02/negative/\">Am I too negative?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/02/negative/feed/") (slash:comments nil "18")) (item nil (title nil "Association for Psychological Science announces a new journal") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/01/american-psychological-society-announces-a-new-journal/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/01/american-psychological-society-announces-a-new-journal/#comments") (pubDate nil "Tue, 01 Apr 2014 13:00:15 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Zombies") (guid ((isPermaLink .

</p></blockquote><p>Ugh.</p><p>But I&#8217;m guessing there are some biggies I&#8217;m missing.  I say this because Grant&#8217;s original list included one paper, by Bland and Altman, with over 27,000 cites, that I&#8217;d never heard of!</p><p>P.S. I agree with Grant that using Google Scholar favors newer papers.  For example, Cooley and Tukey (1965), &#8220;An algorithm for the machine calculation of complex Fourier series,&#8221; does <em>not</em> make the list, amazingly enough, with only 9300 cites.  And the hugely influential book by Snedecor and Cochran has very few cites, I guess cos nobody cites it anymore.  And, of course, the most influential researchers such as Laplace, Gauss, Fisher, Neyman, Pearson, etc., don&#8217;t make the cut.  If Pearson got a cite for every chi-squared test, Neyman for every rejection region, Fisher for every maximum-likelihood estimate, etc., their citations would run into the mid to high zillions each.</p><p>P.P.S.  I wrote this post a few months ago so all the citations have gone up.  For example, the fuzzy sets paper is now listed at 49,000, and Zadeh has a second paper, &#8220;Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes,&#8221; with 16,000 cites.  He puts us all to shame.  On the upside, Efron&#8217;s 1979 paper, &#8220;Bootstrap methods: another look at the jackknife,&#8221; has just pulled itself over the 10,000 cites mark.  That&#8217;s good.

That just makes me want to . . . ok, I won&#8217;t go there.  Anyway, Palko <a href=\"http://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.fr/2014/03/on-sat-chnages-new-york-times-gets.html\">goes to the trouble</a> to explain:</p><blockquote><p>While time management for a test like the SAT can be complicated, the rule for guessing is embarrassingly simple: give your best guess for questions you read; don&#8217;t waste time guessing on questions that you didn&#8217;t have time to read.</p><p>The risk analysis actually becomes much more complicated when you take away the penalty for guessing. On the ACT (or the new SAT), there is a positive expected value associated with blind guessing and that value is large enough to cause trouble. Under severe time constraints (a fairly common occurrence with these tests), the minute it would take you to attempt a problem, even if you get it right, would be better spent filling in bubbles for questions you haven&#8217;t read.</p><p>Putting aside what this does to the validity of the test, trying to decide when to start guessing is a real and needless distraction for test takers.</p></blockquote><p>In summary:</p><blockquote><p>The claim about the effects of the correction for guessing aren&#8217;t just wrong; they are the opposite of right. The old system didn&#8217;t require time-consuming risk analysis but the new one does.</p></blockquote><p>The time control is the key.  Without time control, you look at each question and make your best guess.  It&#8217;s that simple.  And if everybody attempts every question, then taking off points for wrong answers has exactly zero effect.  But if not everyone gets to every question, then the new format creates a clear incentive for people to spend time filling in bubbles to questions they haven&#8217;t looked at.</p><p>Palko has <a href=\"http://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.fr/2014/03/sometimes-sat-you-read-about-in-news.html\">more here</a> on news media reports with horribly confused discussions of the SAT.</p><p>I also clicked through to Balf&#8217;s New York Times magazine article and noticed this:</p><blockquote><p>When the Scholastic Aptitude Test was created in 1926, it was promoted as a tool to create a classless, Jeffersonian-style meritocracy.</p></blockquote><p>Huh? Is a Jeffersonian-style meritocracy the system where everyone is equal and so we all own slaves? I guess if this article were written in Russia it would all about how the SAT was promoted as a tool to create a Lenin-style democracy.</p><p>The problem I see here is that Balf seems to be dealing in images and impressions rather than thinking through his ideas. &#8220;Jefferson&#8221; and &#8220;meritocracy&#8221; have positive images, so they go together, the old SAT was bad so therefore it required &#8220;a time-consuming risk analysis,&#8221; etc.  One journalistic convention that I really can&#8217;t stand is the push toward giving every story a single coherent perspective.  In Balf&#8217;s article, College Board president David Coleman is the hero and so everything about him has to be good and everything he&#8217;s changed has to have been bad.  Another article by someone else might take the opposite stance.

If I succeed in raising doubts about something in the minds of many readers, then that&#8217;s obviously something an author should take seriously. The point is that an author has a responsibility to the readership of the paper, not any one critic.</p></blockquote><p>I agree that the ultimate audience is the scholarly community (and, beyond that, the general public) and that the critic is just serving as a conduit, the person who poses the Q in the Q-and-A.</p><p>That said, I get frustrated frustrated frustrated when people don&#8217;t respond to questions and criticisms from me.  This frustration comes in various flavors.  Perhaps most unreasonable (from my part) is that after I slammed Gregg Easterbrook for an incompetent political column, his editors at Reuters made most of the corrections I suggested (including the links I&#8217;d supplied) but without <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2011/10/20/a-note-to-gregg-easterbrooks-editor-at-reuters/\">acknowledging</a> me in any way.  I still think I was in the right here (it&#8217;s only common courtesy to acknowledge the source of your information), but ultimately the information got out there.</p><p>I got more <a href=\"http://www.symposium-magazine.com/sorry-wrong-number-andrew-gelman/\">frustrated</a> after Arthur Brooks garbled some poll data on happiness and David Brooks mainstreamed some anti-Semitic fake stats, with both these errors coming on the New York Times op-ed page.  What frustrated me was not the erroneous numbers&#8212;after all, I make mistakes too!&#8212;but rather the decisions by the writers (and their editors) not to run corrections, even after the errors were pointed out repeatedly, by myself and others.  (Indeed, in neither case was I the one to the discover the mistake; it was other people who pointed these cases out to me, and then I explored them further.)  I keep coming back to these examples partly because I think the two Brookses can do better:  both of them seem to me to be serious, thoughtful people would like to use their writings to have impact on the world.  In David Brooks&#8217;s case in particular, I hate to see him take the dark path of disseminating what is at best sloppy research and what is at worst disinformation, just because it happens to align in some ways with his political views.</p><p>Or take the case Basbøll is talking about, a paper that recently appeared in a journal of business management.  The paper got some favorable publicity, the editor of the journal promoted the paper in a blog, and then the paper came in for some serious criticism.  The consensus (at least to me) seems to be that the paper is reasonable if a bit overstated in its conclusions, not quite as good as the journal editor claimed but making a real, if specific, contribution to the literature.  But during the discussion some of the commenters were called out as &#8220;trolls.&#8221;  My point:  the &#8220;trolling&#8221; seemed to be necessary to move the scholarly and scientific discussion forward.  Had everyone been super-polite, the journal editor could&#8217;ve just remained in a state of complacency about the paper, but instead the strong comments motivated him and the authors of the paper to respond.</p><p>There&#8217;s also a sense of symmetry, a fight-trolling-with-trolling syndrome.  For example, I&#8217;ve occasionally written about a sociologist who&#8217;s written a series of papers about sex roles and sex ratios of babies.  I&#8217;d call this guy a science troll.  He makes provocative claims based on very weak data and gets lots of attention making &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; statements which would be unremarkable if overheard at the local bar or country club but get attention because of their purported scientific basis.</p><p>Or consider the recent &#8220;Psychological Science&#8221;-style papers by various authors that we&#8217;ve been discussing during the past year on this blog.  I think they too often represent trolling, of a sort, getting attention based on politically loaded claims which are basically unsupported by data.  And are unsupported by theory too, in the sense that their theories are vague enough to explain just about any pattern they see&#8212;or its opposite.</p><p>Just to be clear, I wouldn&#8217;t label the administrative science paper discussed above as trolling.  It&#8217;s a bit of narrow research with broader implications.

The author argues that a steal should be a highly sought after statistic as it equates to higher chances of victory and is very hard to replace when a player is injured.</p><p>I would argue that the reason behind the correlations showing this data is the fact that steals are much more rare in an NBA game than any of the other stats examined so their contribution is exaggerated.</p></blockquote><p>I looked at Morris&#8217;s article and it looks like he&#8217;s running a regression of players&#8217; plus-minus statistics on points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals and turnovers.  He writes, &#8220;A marginal steal is weighted nine times more heavily when predicting a player’s impact than a marginal point.  For example, a player who averages 16 points and two steals per game is predicted (assuming all else is equal) to have a similar impact on his team’s success as one who averages 25 points but only one steal. If these players were on different teams and were both injured at the same time, we would expect their teams to have similar decreases in performance (on average).&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what is being done, though, because plus-minus statistics have been well known for awhile (<a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2007/11/12/bayesian_adjust/\">see here</a>, for example, from 2007) but Morris does not use the term &#8220;plus-minus&#8221; nor does he connect to the literature on it, instead writing, &#8220;I [Morris] used this technique quite a bit throughout my treatise on Dennis Rodman, though it is actually better suited to broader analysis such as this.&#8221;  So this suggests to me that, either I&#8217;m missing something or Morris is.  I expect I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s out of the loop here, so maybe some of you readers can help out.</p><p>From a statistical point of view, we have the usual challenge of distinguishing correlation from causation.  I don&#8217;t think Morris is literally saying that the marginal benefit of a steal is 9 points.  To calibrate, one might try to figure out the marginal benefit of a 2-point shot, which I&#8217;d think would be on average a bit less than 2 points because of the possibility of an offensive rebound.  Or, for that matter, the marginal benefit of a rebound.  But, for Morris&#8217;s goal of player evaluation, the causal effect is not what&#8217;s important.  Rather, his finding is that teams have a better point differential when players with more steals are in the game.  This seems like a reasonable enough regression to me, but at the same time I agree with Vasiloudis that the conclusions look odd.  There&#8217;s not enough of a trail of bread crumbs for me to have confidence in the result.  Which is not to say that I think it&#8217;s wrong, I just don&#8217;t quite know what to think of it.</p><p>P.S.

All graphs are comparison (indeed, all statistical analyses are comparisons).  If you already have the graph in mind, think of what comparisons it’s enabling.  Or if you haven’t settled on the graph yet, think of what comparisons you’d like to make.</p><p>- For example, Tukey described EDA as the search for the unexpected (or something like that, I don’t remember the exact quote).  But, if you think about it, the unexpected is necessarily defined relative to what is expected, thus the (possibly implicit) model that the graph is being compared to.</p><p>- Consider two extreme views:  (a) a graph as a pure exploration, where you bring no expectations whatsoever to the data, (b) a graph as pure execution, you know what you want to show and then you show it.  The truth should always be in between.  Exploration is always relative to expectations, but on the other hand you always want the capacity for being surprised.</p><p>- No need to cram all information onto a single graph.  Make multiple graphs, each clear for its own purpose.</p><p>- A related point:  Make each graph small, then you can put lots of graphs on a page (or screen)</p><p>- A tradeoff:  clarity, recognized graphical forms (time series, scatterplot, etc), and spare (Tufte or Cleveland-like) design make a graph easier to read.  But too many similar-looking spare graphs can blur in the mind and then you’re not fully engaging the reader’s visual brain.  I’m not pro-chartjunk but a bit of color and glitz, even if not strictly necessary, can help.</p><p>- I like line plots.  A graph with two or three lines (labeled directly, not with a legend, please!) allows comparisons across each line and between lines.  I’ve found this to be amazingly effective.</p><p>- You are the first audience for your graphs.  I don’t see a big difference between exploratory graphics and presentation graphics.  When I make graphics for myself, I make them (roughly) presentation quality:  I make them in pdf, give titles and axis labels, grids of graphs, etc.</p><p>- Statistical graphics is commonly presented as being exploratory and about plotting the raw data.  I think that’s important, no doubt about it, and I don’t do enough of it.  In particular, I need better tools for data cleaning.  But, in addition, beyond data exploration, graphics is important for understanding the models we have fit, so I also like the term “exploratory model analysis.&#8221;</p><p>- I’ve only very rarely made dynamic graphs (oddly enough, the only one I can think of offhand, I made for a research project in 1989 and never published or even showed it to anyone else, I think).  This is not a brag.  I think dynamic graphics have great potential.  I just want to be honest about my limitations.  When teaching, it’s good to give the students a good sense of the areas I <em>don’t</em> know about, to help them better map the territory relative to my course material.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/25/statistical-graphics-course-statistical-graphics-advice/\">A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/25/statistical-graphics-course-statistical-graphics-advice/feed/") (slash:comments nil "28")) (item nil (title nil "Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/24/empirical-implications-empirical-implications-theoretical-models/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/24/empirical-implications-empirical-implications-theoretical-models/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 15:30:34 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Bayesian Statistics") (category nil "Miscellaneous Science") (category nil "Political Science") (category nil "Sociology") (guid ((isPermaLink .

But a substantial minority use ‘interpretive research methods’ (sometimes called qualitative methods, for those that call positive research ‘quantitative’).  No one seems entirely happy with the definition of this method, but I’ve found it useful to think of it as an attempt to see the world through the eyes of your subjects, much as Jane Goodall lived with gorillas and tried to see the world through their eyes.)</p><p>Interpretive researchers often criticize positive researchers by noting that the latter don’t make the best use of their data, because they come to the data with a predetermined theory, and only test a narrow set of hypotheses to accept or reject.  In contrast, the interpretive researchers dwell in their data (interviews and observation) to develop their theories.  Sure, it might fail Popper’s requirements of falsifiability, but is that such an unreasonable tradeoff if you get to use all of your data?  </p><p>Now to my questions.  First, how different is the interpretive argument from the usual Bayesian critique of frequentist hypothesis testing?  Isn’t much of the argument that frequentist hypothesis-testers are ignoring the bulk of their data in order to get a yay or nay on one narrow question?  Second, does the increased focus on big data make quantitative statistics even more consistent with the interpretive view?  If someone is given the first crack at a big data set, isn’t the Bayesian recommendation to wallow in the data and use it to develop theory, rather than spell out some narrow hypotheses and try to reject or accept them using (most likely) a small slice of the big data? </p><p>No doubt I’ve muddied the issues by using loaded terms like Bayesian, frequentist, and big data.  But hopefully the question makes enough sense to be answered.  Any references you or your readers could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>As an aside, I should mention that I think that most positive researchers aren’t nearly as pure as Popper and other falsificationists would demand.  Most of the studies in my field are statistical analyses of the exact same data sets studied by many researchers before them (stock prices, accounting disclosures and the like), so basically every paper tests theories that have been developed by others who examined almost exactly the same data sets.  And no one admits it, but they all run a host of analyses before reporting their final hypothesis tests.  I’m not criticizing, only noting that they seem to dwell in their data more like an interpretive researcher than one would guess from reading their published papers.</p></blockquote><p>My reply:</p><p>In political science, I&#8217;ve sometimes heard the phrase, &#8220;empirical implications of theoretical models,&#8221; which sounds similar to what is called &#8220;positive research methods&#8221; in your field.  In either case it looks like a sort of extreme Popperism that goes as follows:</p><p>1.  Researcher A uses theory to come up with a clear set of testable hypotheses.</p><p>2.  Researcher B gathers data and comes to a conclusion, which is either:</p><p>(a) Whew!  The hypothesis is not rejected.  It lives another day and is stronger by virtue of surviving the test; or</p><p>(b) Wow!  The hypothesis is rejected.  Start the revolution.</p><p>3.  Either way, you win.  You&#8217;ve either supported a model you like, or you&#8217;ve shot down a formerly-live model.  Typically, though, the goal is (a).  You&#8217;re supposed to specify the hypothesis in a way that can be testable, then you&#8217;re supposed to design the data collection in a way so that you&#8217;re likely to learn something about the hypothesis (or perhaps to distinguish between two hypotheses, although that formulation has always made me uncomfortable, in that once we entertain hypothesis X and hypothesis Y, I&#8217;d like to do continuous model expansion and consider X and Y to be special cases of a more general hypothesis Z, and at this point I consider &#8220;X or Y&#8221; to be a dead question.  </p><p>In theory, researchers A and B can come from different research groups&#8212;they don&#8217;t even need to know each other&#8212;but there seems to be a sense that it&#8217;s best for them to be the same person.  In this way, empirical implications of theoretical models seems to be following the James Taylor rather than the Frank Sinatra model. The singer is the songwriter.</p><p>One difficulty of the Empirical Implications paradigm is that, in practice, the testable hypotheses can be pretty vague and can map many different ways into empirical data.  This is what Eric Loken and I call <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf\">the garden of forking paths</a>.</p><p><strong>Popper turned upside down</strong></p><p>Even setting aside any difficulties of specifying research hypotheses, one odd thing about the above Popperian approach is that the hypothesis being tested is, in the terms of classical statistical analysis, an &#8220;alternative hypothesis&#8221; not a &#8220;null hypothesis.&#8221;</p><p>To put it yet another way, the <em>research</em> hypothesis (the &#8220;theoretical model&#8221; whose &#8220;empirical implications&#8221; are being tested) is (typically) something you want to uphold, whereas the <em>statistical</em> null hypothesis is a straw man (or, as Dave Krantz would say, a straw person) that you want to reject.</p><p>And I&#8217;m not just playing with words here.  The two hypotheses are exact hypotheses, in that support of the research hypothesis (an outcome of the form 2(a) in the above story) is typically defined <em>precisely</em> as a statistical rejection of the null hypothesis.</p><p>This is Popper turned upside down.  It could still all make sense&#8212;but we just have to keep in mind that rejection in the Neyman-Pearson sense counts as non-rejection in the Popper sense, and non-rejection in the Neyman-Pearson sense counts as rejection in the Popper sense.  I don&#8217;t think this point is generally clear at all.</p><p><strong>To get back to the original question</strong></p><p>In my own research, I think data exploration is super-important.  Much of my most influential and important applied work never could or would have happened had I been required to follow the Empirical Implications playbook and write out my hypotheses ahead of time.  For example, see <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/rb_qjps.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/democracy2.pdf\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/bjps1993.pdf\">here</a>.  In all these cases, it was only through lots of data analyses that my collaborators and I came to our research hypotheses.  I see the appeal of Empirical Implications in pushing researchers to a sort of intellectual discipline but I don&#8217;t think it would work for me.</p><p>Finally, I think the whole Bayesian thing is a red herring here.  As Uri Simonsohn has <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2374040\">explained</a>, you can p-hack just as well with Bayes as with any other approach.  As I see it, the problem is not with classical rules or even with p-values but rather comes earlier, with a confusion between research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses and an attitude that an extreme p-value or posterior probability or whatever can be taken as strong evidence, without reference to how that number came about.  </p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/24/empirical-implications-empirical-implications-theoretical-models/\">Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/24/empirical-implications-empirical-implications-theoretical-models/feed/") (slash:comments nil "34")) (item nil (title nil "On deck this week") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/24/deck-week-5/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/24/deck-week-5/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 15:00:44 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Decision Theory") (guid ((isPermaLink .

With taxes, it yields only $1,000. In effect, once the entire tax system is taken into account, my family&#8217;s marginal tax rate is about 90 percent. Is it any wonder that I [Mankiw] turn down most of the money-making opportunities I am offered?</p><p>By contrast, without the tax increases advocated by the Obama administration, the numbers would look quite different. I would face a lower income tax rate, a lower Medicare tax rate, and no deduction phaseout or estate tax. Taking that writing assignment would yield my kids about $2,000. I would have twice the incentive to keep working.</p></blockquote><p><strong>First, the good news</strong></p><p>Obama&#8217;s tax rates are much lower than Mankiw had anticipated!  According to the above quote, his marginal tax rate is currently 80% but threatens to rise to 90%.</p><p>But, in October 2008, Mankiw <a href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/10/blog-post.html\">calculated</a> that Obama&#8217;s would tax his marginal dollar at 93%.  What we&#8217;re saying, then, is that Mankiw&#8217;s marginal tax rate is currently thirteen percentage points lower than he&#8217;d anticipated two years ago.  In fact, Mankiw&#8217;s stated current marginal tax rate of 80% is three points lower than the tax rate he expected to pay under a McCain administration!  And if the proposed new tax laws are introduced, Mankiw&#8217;s marginal tax rate of 90% is <em>still</em> three percentage points lower than he&#8217;d anticipated, back during the 2008 election campaign.  I assume that, for whatever reason, Obama did not follow through on all his tax-raising promises.</p><p>To frame the numbers more dramatically:  According to Mankiw&#8217;s calculations, he is currently keeping <em>almost three times</em> the proportion of his income that he was expecting to keep under the Obama administration (and 18% more than he was expecting to keep under a hypothetical McCain administration).  If the new tax plans are put into effect, Mankiw will still keep 43% more of his money than he was expecting to keep, only two years ago.  (For those following along at home, the calculations are (1-0.80)/(1-0.93)=2.9, (1-0.80)/(1-0.83)=1.18, and (1-0.90)/(1-0.93)=1.43.)</p><p>Given that Mankiw currently gets to keep 20% of his money&#8212;rather than the measly 7% he was anticipating&#8212;it&#8217;s no surprise that he&#8217;s still working!</p><p><strong>Now, the bad news</strong></p><p>I don&#8217;t think Mankiw has fully thought this through.
<div class=\"mt-post-excerpt-divider\"></div><p>He writes as if he&#8217;s writing newspaper articles for the money.  (&#8220;Now you might not care if I supply less of my services to the marketplace&#8212;although, because you are reading this article, you are one of my customers.&#8221;)  I don&#8217;t believe it.  I think he&#8217;s writing the articles because he has views that he thinks are important and he wants to share them with the world.  Like blogging, but with more readers.  As you all know, we blog for free.  And, for people like Mankiw (or even me), when we write newspaper articles it&#8217;s pretty much for free too. There are a lot easier ways for us to make $1000 than to write an article for the newspaper.  From a financial standpoint, the only reason to do it is that we were already planning to write the article for free.</p><p>In which case, the marginal tax rate doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with it.  Sure, it&#8217;s fun to get these little checks&#8212;just the other day, I received a bank deposit from the Wall Street Journal for an article they <em>didn&#8217;t</em> publish&#8212;but let&#8217;s not kid ourselves that we&#8217;re doing it for the money, or even for our kids (who I think will do just fine without that extra $1000 in their inheritance).</p><p><strong>What Mankiw could do with the money</strong></p><p>The last time this came up, a couple of years ago, Mankiw wrote the following in response to Obama&#8217;s threatened 93% marginal tax rate:</p><blockquote><p>The bottom line: If you are one of those people out there trying to induce me [Mankiw] to do some work for you, there is a good chance I will turn you down. And the likelihood will go up after President Obama puts his tax plan in place. I expect to spend more time playing with my kids. They will be poorer when they grow up, but perhaps they will have a few more happy memories.</p></blockquote><p>And here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/12/greg_mankiws_wo.html\">what I wrote at the time</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To start with, it does sound like Mankiw&#8217;s kids are already well provided for, and, although I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d disagree with me on this, it&#8217;s not clear that they would benefit from having more money in the bank when their parents are gone.</p><p>So, from that point of view, the question is why Mankiw isn&#8217;t already spending more time playing with his kids?</p><p>I can&#8217;t speak for him, but for me, I have to say that it can be fun to work (or even to write blog entries). But, more than that, I feel a sense of obligation to get things done. At some level, getting paid is part of the motivation, but in any particular example I&#8217;m not quite sure how it fits in. I do lots of work things that pay me $0; I think they&#8217;re important, so I do them.</p></blockquote><p>When I get extra money, one thing I spend it on is students, assistants, and postdocs.  But, for that, the marginal tax rate is nothing close to 90% or even 80%.  For Mankiw, I&#8217;m not sure; maybe he makes enough from his textbooks that he doesn&#8217;t need much of his academic salary and could possibly do more by converting it into postdocs and research assistants. Or maybe he already has more research assistants than he knows what to do with; I don&#8217;t know. But his division of waking hours into &#8220;working&#8221; or &#8220;playing with kids&#8221; is, I would guess, not very sensitive to the marginal tax rate.</p><p><strong>Back to taxes</strong></p><p>In writing the above, I&#8217;m not trying to suggest that the tax rate be X% or Y% or Z%. I don&#8217;t know anything about macroeconomics and have nothing to offer you, the readers, on this topic.</p><p>My real point:  <em>economics is hard</em>.  Greg Mankiw is one of the world&#8217;s experts on macroeconomics, but when it comes to a seemingly simple problem in micro&#8212;anticipating his personal reactions to taxation&#8212;he messes it up, making the classic error of considering only monetary motivations and, bizarrely, suggesting that he&#8217;s not out playing with his kids because he&#8217;d rather make a thousand bucks writing a newspaper article.  It&#8217;s not that I think Mankiw is insincere; I think he just underestimates the difficulty of thinking clearly about decision making.  (I know much much much less than Mankiw about economics, but I&#8217;ve done enough research in <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/decision-theory/\">decision analysis</a> to know the challenges that arise in analyzing even the simplest decisions.)</p><p><strong>The irony of hard-headedness</strong></p><p>The irony is that Mankiw (like so many people, particularly economists!) is conditioned to be hard-headed and think that it&#8217;s all about the benjamins, when, really, he&#8217;s writing newspaper articles for the completely sane reason that he wants to make the world a better place, and he&#8217;d like to do this by presenting cogent arguments that can help convince people that his views are correct.  I assume that Mankiw sincerely believes that higher taxes on the rich are a bad thing and will ultimately make everyone less well-off (just as Krugman, say, believes the opposite).  But he feels uncomfortable characterizing his actions as idealistic and, as a result, ends up placing his work and child-care decisions into a nearly nonsensical framework of dollars and cents.</p><p>P.S.  More <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2010/10/update_on_manki.html\">here</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Update (2014):</p><p>All questions of tax policy aside, I think the above story is important, in that it illustrates how a smart guy can get trapped inside a mathematical model and not even realize it, sort of the philosophical equivalent of a person living on a large, interesting island who naively thinks that this island is the entire world.</p><p>As I <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2010/10/11/mankiws_margina/#comment-56410\">wrote</a> in the comments thread, I don&#8217;t think Mankiw is being insincere. My guess is that he&#8217;s being sincere but is working within an impoverished model that does not fully account for non-monetary rationales for his work. He can accept that he plays with his kids for non-monetary reasons; why is it so difficult to accept that he writes newspaper columns for nonmonetary reasons also? I&#8217;m not saying he should not write more columns; I just think it&#8217;s a bit silly to analyze that decision based on his dollar compensation for them, given that this has got to be the most minor reason for writing them.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/greg-mankiws-utility-function/\">Greg Mankiw&#8217;s utility function</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/greg-mankiws-utility-function/feed/") (slash:comments nil "68")) (item nil (title nil "Win probabilities during a sporting event") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/23074/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/23074/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sun, 23 Mar 2014 05:19:47 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Bayesian Statistics") (category nil "Sports") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Anyway, then I had Jamaican beef patties on the brain so I went by Monday afternoon and asked for 9:  3 spicy beef, 3 mild beef (for the kids), and 3 chicken (not the jerk chicken; Bob got those the other day and they didn&#8217;t impress me).  I&#8217;m about to pay and then a bunch of people come in and start ordering.  The woman behind the counter asks if I&#8217;m in a hurry, I ask why, she whispers, For the same price you can get a dozen.  So I get two more spicy beef and a chicken.  She whispers that I shouldn&#8217;t tell anyone.  I can&#8217;t really figure out why I&#8217;m getting this special treatment.  So I walk out of there with 12 patties.  Total cost:  $17.25.

A bit over 100 years ago, social scientists such as Galton applied this theorem to all sorts of biological and social phenomena. The central limit theorem, in its generality, is also important in the information that it indirectly conveys when it fails.</p><p>For example, the distribution of the heights of adult men or women is nicely bell-shaped, but the distribution of the heights of all adults has a different, more spread-out distribution. This is because your height is the sum of many small factors and one large factor&#8212;your sex. The conditions of the theorem are that no single factor (or small number of factors) should be important on its own. For another example, it has long been observed that incomes do not follow a bell-shaped curve, even on the logarithmic scale. Nor do sizes of cities and many other social phenomena. These “power-law curves,” which don’t fit the central limit theorem, have motivated social scientists such as Herbert Simon to come up with processes more complicated than simple averaging (for example, models in which the rich get richer).</p><p>The central limit theorem is an example of an attractor&#8212;a mathematical model that appears as a limit as sample size gets large. The key feature of an attractor is that it destroys information. Think of it as being like a funnel: all sorts of things can come in, but a single thing&#8212;the bell-shaped curve&#8212;comes out. (Or, for other models, such as that used to describe the distribution of incomes, the attractor might be a power-law distribution.) The beauty of an attractor is that, if you believe the model, it can be used to explain an observed pattern without needing to know the details of its components. Thus, for example, we can see that the heights of men or of women have bell-shaped distributions, without knowing the details of the many small genetic and environmental influences on height.</p><p>Now to random matrices.</p><div></div><p>A random matrix is an array of numbers, where each number is drawn from some specified probability distribution. You can compute the eigenvalues of a square matrix&#8212;that’s a set of numbers summarizing the structure of the matrix&#8212;and they will have a probability distribution that is induced by the probability distribution of the individual elements of the matrix. Over the past few decades, mathematicians such as Alan Edelman have performed computer simulations and proved theorems deriving the distribution of the eigenvalues of a random matrix, as the dimension of the matrix becomes large.</p><p>It appears that the eigenvalue distribution is an attractor. That is, for a broad range of different input models (distributions of the random matrices), you get the same output&#8212;the same eigenvalue distribution&#8212;as the sample size becomes large. This is interesting, and it’s hard to prove. (At least, it seemed hard to prove the last time I looked at it, about 20 years ago, and I’m sure that it’s even harder to make advances in the field today!)</p><p>Now, to return to the news article. If the eigenvalue distribution is an attractor, this means that a lot of physical and social phenomena which can be modeled by eigenvalues (including, apparently, quantum energy levels and some properties of statistical tests) might have a common structure. Just as, at a similar level, we see the normal distribution and related functions in all sorts of unusual places.</p><p>Consider this quote from Buchanan’s article:</p><blockquote><p>Recently, for example, physicist Ferdinand Kuemmeth and colleagues at Harvard University used it to predict the energy levels of electrons in the gold nanoparticles they had constructed. Traditional theories suggest that such energy levels should be influenced by a bewildering range of factors, including the precise shape and size of the nanoparticle and the relative position of the atoms, which is considered to be more or less random. Nevertheless, Kuemmeth’s team found that random matrix theory described the measured levels very accurately.</p></blockquote><p>That’s what an attractor is all about: different inputs, same output.</p><p>Thus, I don’t quite understand this quote:</p><blockquote><p>Random matrix theory has got mathematicians like Percy Deift of New York University imagining that there might be more general patterns there too. “This kind of thinking isn’t common in mathematics,” he notes. ‘Mathematicians tend to think that each of their problems has its own special, distinguishing features. But in recent years we have begun to see that problems from diverse areas, often with no discernible connections, all behave in a very similar way.</p></blockquote><p>This doesn’t seem like such a surprise to me&#8212;it seems very much in the tradition of mathematical modeling. But maybe there’s something I’m missing here.</p><p>Finally, Buchanan turns to social science:</p><blockquote><p>An economist may sift through hundreds of data sets looking for something to explain changes in inflation – perhaps oil futures, interest rates or industrial inventories. Businesses such as Amazon.com rely on similar techniques to spot patterns in buyer behaviour and help direct their advertising.</p><p>While random matrix theory suggests that this is a promising approach, it also points to hidden dangers. As more and more complex data is collected, the number of variables being studied grows, and the number of apparent correlations between them grows even faster. With enough variables to test, it becomes almost certain that you will detect correlations that look significant, even if they aren’t. . . . even if these variables are all fluctuating randomly, the largest observed correlation will be large enough to seem significant.</p></blockquote><p>This is well known. The new idea is that mathematical theory might enable the distribution of these correlations to be understood for a general range of cases. That’s interesting but doesn’t alter the basic statistical ideas.</p><p>Beyond this, I think there’s a flaw in the idea that statistics (or econometrics) proceeds by blindly looking at the correlations among all variables. In my experience, it makes more sense to fit a hierarchical model, using structure in the economic indexes rather than just throwing them all in as predictors. We are in fact studying the properties of hierarchical models when the number of cases and variables becomes large, and it’s a hard problem. Maybe the ideas from random matrix theory will be relevant here too.</p><p>Buchanan writes:</p><p>In recent years, some economists have begun to express doubts over predictions made from huge volumes of data, but they are in the minority. Most embrace the idea that more measurements mean better predictive abilities. That might be an illusion, and random matrix theory could be the tool to separate what is real and what is not.</p><p>I’m with most economists here: I think that, on average, more measurements do mean better predictive abilities! Maybe not if you are only allowed to look at correlations and least-squares regressions, but if you can model with more structure than, yes, more information should be better.</p></blockquote><p>Update (2014):</p><p>I wonder how things are going in this field.

I&#8217;ve elaborated upon it since including it in <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/bag-of-tricks/\">the Teaching Statistics book</a> and I thought these tips might be useful to some of you.</p><p><strong>Preparation</strong></p><p>Buy 100 candies of different sizes and shapes and put them in a bag (the plastic bag from the store is fine). Get something like 20 large full-sized candy bars, 20 or 30 little things like mini Snickers bars and mini Peppermint Patties. And then 50 or 60 really little things like tiny Tootsie Rolls, lollipops, and individually-wrapped Life Savers. Count and make sure it&#8217;s exactly 100.</p><p>You also need a digital kitchen scale that reads out in grams.</p><p>Also bring a sealed envelope inside of which is a note (details below). When you get into the room, unobtrusively put the note somewhere, for example between two books on a shelf or behind a window shade.</p><p><strong>Setup</strong></p><p>Hold up the back of candy and the scale and write the following on the board:</p><p>Each pair of students should:<br />
1. Pull 5 candies out of the bag<br />
2. Weigh the candies<br />
3. Write down the weight<br />
4. Put the candies back in the bag!!<br />
5. Pass the scale and bag to your neighbors<br />
6. Silently multiply the weight of the 5 candies by 20.</p><p>(And, as Frank Morgan told me once, remember to read aloud everything you write on the board. Don&#8217;t write silently.)</p><p>The students should work in pairs. Explain that their goal is to estimate the total weight of all the candies in the bag. They can choose their 5 candies using any method&#8211;systematic sampling, random sampling, whatever. Whichever pair guesses closest to the true weight. they get the whole bag!</p><p>Demonstrate how to zero the scale, give the scale and the bag of candies to a pair of students in the front row, and let them go.</p><p><strong>Action</strong></p><p>The demo will proceed silently while the rest of the class proceeds. So do whatever you were going to do in class. Take a look to make sure the scale and bag are moving slowly through the room. After about 30 or 40 minutes, it will reach the back and the students will be done.</p><p>At this point, ask the pairs, one at a time, to call out their estimates. Write them on the board. They will be numbers like 3080, 2400, 4340, and so forth. Once all the numbers are written, make a crude histogram (for example, bins from 2000-3000 grams, 3000-4000, 4000-5000, etc.). This represents the sampling distribution of the estimates.</p><p>Now call up two students from the class (but not from the same pair) to look at all the estimates. Ask them what their best guess is, having seen this information. As the class if they agree with these two students. Now give the bag to the two students in the front of the room and have them weigh it.</p><p><strong>Punch line</strong></p><p>The weight of all 100 candies will be something like 1658. It&#8217;s always, always, always lower than <em>all</em> of the individual guesses on the board. Write this true weight as a vertical bar on the histogram that you&#8217;ve drawn. This is a great way to illustrate the concepts of bias and standard error of an estimator.</p><p>Now call out to the students who are sitting near where you hid the envelope: &#8220;Um, uh, what&#8217;s that over there . . . is it an envelope??? Really? What&#8217;s inside? Could you open it up?&#8221; A student opens it and reads out what&#8217;s written on the sheet inside: &#8220;Your guesses are all too high!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p><p>Now&#8217;s the time to talk about sampling. Large candies are easy to see and to grab, while small candies fall through the gaps between the large ones and end up at the bottom of the bag. You can draw analogies to doing a random sample by going to the mall or by sending out an email survey and seeing who responds. Ask, How could you do a random sample. It won&#8217;t be obvious to the students that the way to do a random sample is to number each of the candies from 1 to 100 and pick numbers at random. Also, as noted above, this is an example you can use later in the semester to illustrate bias and standard error.</p><p>P.S. My feeling about describing these demos is the same as what Penn and Teller say about why they show audiences how they do their tricks: it&#8217;s even cooler when you know how it works.</p><p>P.P.S. Remember&#8211;it&#8217;s crucial that the candies in the bag be of varying sizes, with a few big ones and lots of little ones!</p></blockquote><p>Update (2014):</p><p>The <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2008/05/08/doing_the_candy/#comments\">comment thread</a> on that one is pretty good too.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/20/candy-weighing-demonstration-unwisdom-crowds/\">The candy weighing demonstration, or, the unwisdom of crowds</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/20/candy-weighing-demonstration-unwisdom-crowds/feed/") (slash:comments nil "18")) (item nil (title nil "How Americans vote") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/19/americans-vote/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/19/americans-vote/#comments") (pubDate nil "Wed, 19 Mar 2014 13:09:28 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Political Science") (guid ((isPermaLink .

I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would have felt they needed to know all the important secrets in it. Instead, I gave it this accessible title which meant that people felt that they didn’t necessarily have to read it. I also regret not putting more about the process of discovery in that book, how we found out what we found out.</p><p>What would you have called the book if you were given another chance?</p><p>Maybe something like <em>Voting by the Numbers</em> or <em>The Hidden Patterns</em> or <em>Secret Life of the American Voter</em>, something like that. Or something very dry, that conveyed it was serious, like <em>Demography, Geography and American Voting</em>. Almost every time there was a graph, it involved a separate little research project. I put in huge amounts of effort. As they say in poker, I went all in on it, I wanted to make it the best possible thing.</p><p>I notice from your blog as well that <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/06/stop-me-before-i-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/\">one of the stereotypes</a> that you are keen on debunking is this idea that working-class people in America vote conservative. A number of people have <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340019063&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=what%27s+the+matter+with+kansas\">gone to some lengths</a> to try to explain this phenomenon, but you seem to think it’s a bit of a red herring.</p><p>Somehow people on the left and on the right find it difficult to understand. On the left, people think that 100% of working-class people should vote for the left, so anything less than 100% makes them feel that there is something that went wrong. They just cannot understand how this could be. On the right, you get the opposite. It’s considered a validation – they want to believe that these more virtuous people are voting for them. But even in the days of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, a lot of low-income people voted Republican. There was no magic golden age in which lower-income working-class people were uniformly Democrat. It was always various subgroups of the population.</p><p>How many of the poor did vote for the Democrats, say, in the last election?</p><p>Of the lowest third of the population about 60% voted for the Democrats.</p><p>What if you narrow it down to blue-collar workers though? Don’t the majority of them vote conservative?</p><p>Then you have to ask, what does that exactly mean? Someone could make $100,000 a year and be blue collar. Conversely, if you’re a woman cleaning bedpans and making very little money, you’re not blue collar. Cleaning bedpans is not considered blue-collar work. There is the way that, firstly, blue collar conveys some sort of moral superiority, and secondly that it just happens to exclude a lot of the female workforce, who are more likely to be Democrats. If you take only blue collar – which is mostly male – and don’t even restrict for income and then you go beyond that to only include whites, you’re chipping away at various groups that support the Democrats, without noticing what’s happening. It sounds very innocuous to talk about blue-collar whites, but you’re selecting a subgroup among this social class which is particularly conservative, and then making some claims about them.</p><p>What’s the single most interesting thing you discovered writing your book?</p></blockquote><p><span id=\"more-22854\"></span></p><blockquote><p>If I had to summarise one thing from <em>Red State, Blue State</em> that we discovered, it’s the fact that the biggest differences between red states and blue states are occurring at the upper-income level, rather than the lower-income level. If you look at high-income voters, America is very geographically and ideologically divided. If you look at lower-income voters, there’s less division. That was really our big point.</p><p>Explain a bit more.</p><p>If you compare states like New York and California on the one hand and Texas on the other, the lower-income voters in these states don’t differ so much. Obama did better among lower-income voters in New York than in Texas, but it wasn’t as different as the differences among high-income voters. Another way of saying this is that if you compare people’s attitudes from surveys in Republican-leaning states to Democrat-leaning states, low-income people don’t differ much, on average, in their social and economic attitudes. Low-income Americans tend to be economically liberal and fairly moderate on social issues. Upper-middle-class Americans, on other hand, vary a lot by region. In Republican states they tend to be very conservative on economic issues and moderate on social issues. In Democrat-leaning states, upper-middle-class or rich people tend to be moderately conservative on economics and liberal on social issues.</p><p>If you look at the very richest Americans – we don’t know about them from surveys, but we can look at campaign contributions – they’re very important campaign contributors for the Republicans. The rich supporters of the Republicans are very conservative economically. The very richest Americans are also very important contributors for the Democrats. But the rich supporters of the Democrats are not ultra-left economically. The richest people on the left don’t like the Republicans, they’ll support moderately higher taxes and so forth, but they’re not socialists. They’re not so extreme. So there’s an asymmetry there.</p><p>As a statistician, if you were giving Obama election advice now, what would you tell him to do?</p><p>He needs to do what’s possible to make people feel more prosperous. He knows that. Both sides have a lot of experts so they understand that. I don’t know if I have any special advice. They’re going to put most of their effort on swing states, which makes sense, but I don’t think they’re going to learn much from polling these states and finding out little fluctuations. Public opinion swings tend to be national swings.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><blockquote><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50301\"><div><img title=\"The Almanac of American Politics 2012\" alt=\"Image of The Almanac of American Politics 2012\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514TLXKQ6oL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"107\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Almanac of American Politics\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">The Almanac of American Politics</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Almanac of American Politics\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">By Michael Barone and Chuck McCutcheon</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Let’s talk about this some more in the context of the books you’ve chosen. You’ve started with <em>The Almanac of American Politics, </em>which is published every two years by <em><a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/\">The National Journal</a></em>.</p><p>This first came out in 1971 and it was written for many years by a journalist named Michael Barone. It was really an amazing book, especially when it first came out. It had 435 chapters, a little essay about each congressional district in the country, who lived there and what it was like. It’s a book that’s been very important to political professionals, but it’s almost like a bit of sociology. If you read a book about contemporary America it will focus on whatever it focuses on, whatever the interests of the author are. Even a book that’s more encyclopaedic, might talk about the 50 states. But the 50 states are different sizes, and some are much bigger than others. By being forced to write a little essay about each congressional district, this book created a geographically balanced portrait of America, which you just could not get anywhere else. And it was just fun to read.</p><p>Now – you could always tell this but over the years it became more and more of a clear pattern – there is a bit of an ideological bias in the book. Barone is now an outspoken conservative – in fact he embarrassed himself a few years ago by saying that the liberal media had attacked Sarah Palin because she did not abort her Down syndrome baby. Then he apologised and said it was a joke. Going back to <em>The Almanac of American Politics</em>, you realise he has a little bit of a thumb on the scale. If he’s talking about a place where people vote for Democrats, it always seems to be a declining, rust-belt, corrupt area, and when it’s an area that’s voting for Republicans, it’s always a dynamic, exciting part of the country. But it’s still amazing. Go back and read some of the early ones especially, and then skip a decade and read it again, and you get a portrait of America that, even if it’s not perfect, is unique.</p><p>Did you use it for your research?</p><p>In 1990 when I got my PhD I went to Berkeley into the statistics department. They offered me a few thousand dollars so I could buy a home computer. I said I didn’t want one – I would take the money and buy books instead. This was one of the books on the list. This was the book that, in the old days, every American political scientist would have on their shelf. There’s no substitute. Even Wikipedia is not really a substitute. If you want to look up any particular district, you can look it up, but having a book where every district takes up the same amount of space, there’s just something amazing about it.</p><p>Give an example of something I might want to look up.</p><p>You might want to look up something you’re personally interested in, like where you live or where you went to college, or where your mother grew up. Or you might open up to anywhere. What’s the 19th district in Illinois like? And it would be this thumbnail portrait of this area of 700,000 Americans, and what makes them vote one way or the other. Of course it has numbers too. It’s a bit like one of these baseball statistics books. You have the description of the player and then his statistics. You can see how the Republicans and Democrats have done in elections in these districts.</p><p>OK, I’ll look up the part of New York state I live in, because I’ve always wondered about the political attitudes of the people around me. It seems to be impolite in America to talk about politics or ask any direct questions, so this may be a way around that.</p><p>It is public information if people are registered for a party. If you’re a registered Democrat I should be able to find that out just by going and looking at the public records. I was just reading an autobiography of Ring Lardner Jr. He’s famous for writing the screenplay for M*A*S*H, and he was part of a Hollywood blacklist for many years. He had a story about how the FBI had been following him for decades because they knew how he voted. We’re supposed to have a secret ballot, but in his precinct in Los Angeles he was the only person listed who was neither Democrat nor Republican. When they posted the election results after election day, there were a certain number of people who voted for Franklin Roosevelt, the Democrat, and a certain number of people who voted for Alf Landon the Republican, and then there was one vote for the Communist.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50302\"><div><img title=\"The 480\" alt=\"Image of The 480\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qmkg9R5SL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The 480\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">The 480</a></h2><p><a title=\"The 480\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">By Eugene Burdick</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Let’s go on to your next book, <em>The 480,</em> by Eugene Burdick.</p><p>This is a novel that was written in 1964, by one of the authors of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Ugly-American-Eugene-Burdick/dp/0393318672?Tag=thebro-21\"><em>The</em> <em>Ugly</em> <em>American</em></a>, which is a book you might not have ever heard of but you’ve heard the phrase. It was a cultural touchstone. It came out in the late 1950s, and it took place in a hypothetical, Vietnam-like country in Asia, and it’s about the Americans losing the war of hearts and minds to the Communists.</p><p><em>The 480</em> is about evil political consultants who are manipulating the American public to vote for an empty-suit type of character for president. The number 480 referred to an actual analysis that was done by some political scientists, including a political scientist named Sam Popkin, who is now at the University of California in San Diego. They divided the population into 480 demographic and geographic subgroups, based on things like religion, age, sex, what region of the country and so on. The idea was that they knew how many people were in each group and they would pitch their messages to those groups. It’s a classic work in political science. I think they also advised the Kennedy campaign. Back then it was very impressive, but we can do much more now in terms of data analysis, we can get estimates for all 50 states now which they couldn’t do back then.</p><p>But there was something funny about this book, about these backroom political consultants manipulating the election. It’s not at all realistic, though it’s much more realistic than a book like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manchurian-Candidate-Richard-Condon/dp/1568582706/?Tag=thebro-21\"><em>The</em> <em>Manchurian</em> <em>Candidate</em></a>, which is a big joke. This book is a satire but it reflects serious concerns about politics.</p><p>Presumably, then, the implication is that there is something sinister about having all this information?</p><p>The idea is that these people know enough about us so that they can manipulate our vote. Realistically, political consultants nowadays know a lot about us, and they do try to convince us. There are two kinds of people they follow. One is people where they know who they’re going to vote for, but they’re not sure that they’re going to vote. The other is people who are very likely to vote, but you don’t know which way they’re going to vote. The first type of person they try to mobilise just to turn out and vote, and the second kind of person they try to persuade. They’re pretty good at knowing who people are. In fact, at this point, a lot of this is just a question of resources. To the extent they have resources they will go out to people and call you on the phone. If they think you’re already likely to vote for a certain candidate, they’ll try to find somebody to knock on your door and convince you that it’s an important election and it’s worth voting for. In some sense it’s not as mysterious or conspiratorial as it’s made out to be in that book.</p><p>It’s just a question of resources?</p><p>Yes, it’s expensive. It’s said to cost about $40 per vote. You have to get enthusiastic volunteers and really knock on people’s doors.</p><p>It’s not about sending out some subliminal message – it’s just about having someone enthusiastic on your doorstep?</p><p>They do play with the messages a lot. They do a lot of experimentation. I remember reading one paper that came out where they framed the same question in two different ways. They try to say things like, “Everybody votes, so you should vote too.” I don’t know how much I believe it, but from some experimental evidence they claim that certain phrasing is particularly effective. Of course both sides are doing it, which is what you’d want. It’s only fair for both sides to do it. A lot of the great inequalities arise before you get to the general election. Certain candidates just don’t have a chance in the primary because they don’t have the money. The two parties are more equally balanced. The other issues in unfairness come in what policies the parties consider. The actual election is not too far from a fair fight.</p><p>What do you mean by unfairness in the policies parties consider?</p><p>I mean that there are policies that get proposed and policies that don’t get proposed, and the lobbyists have an impact. When the election year comes up, we think a lot about elections. But if you think about what issues get raised in Congress and what things the president does and doesn’t do, a lot of those are going to be affected by campaign contributors.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50303\"><div><img title=\"The Rational Public: Fifty Years of Trends in Americans&amp;#039; Policy Preferences (American Politics and Political Economy Series)\" alt=\"Image of The Rational Public: Fifty Years of Trends in Americans&amp;#039; Policy Preferences (American Politics and Political Economy Series)\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EbVJkmWRL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"105\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Rational Public\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">The Rational Public</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Rational Public\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">By Benjamin I Page and Robert Y Shapiro</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Tell me about <em>The Rational Public: 50 Years of Trends in Americans’ Policy Preferences.</em></p><p><em>The Rational Public</em> was written by two political scientists, Ben Page and Bob Shapiro. Bob Shapiro has the office next to mine in the political science department here at Columbia. The book came out in 1992 and they found something in public opinion that my colleagues and I had already noticed in elections, which is something we call “uniform partisan swing”. I don’t know how it is in other countries, but the basic idea is that Americans are spread out on some left-right scale, and we are, of course, quite diverse in our opinions. But when there is a change in opinion it tends to move everybody together. Not always, but generally. For example, gay rights are more popular than they used to be, amongst pretty much all groups. Or attitudes about economic issues – Americans are more economically conservative and more socially liberal than they used to be. Things tend to move at a national level.</p><p>Normally, when you have an election, it’s the same. Barack Obama is expected to get 4% to 5% less of the vote this election than last time. It’s roughly the same amount less in every state. Page and Shapiro looked at a whole bunch of issues and found that people were moving together.</p><p>They also found that people’s attitudes were rational, they made some sense. There have been findings in public opinion literature about something called “non-attitudes”, which is that sometimes you ask people a question and you come back and ask them later and they seem to have a completely different answer. But on issues that people have thought about, people have fairly sensible views. Often people have reasonable views that are not always conveyed that well, because they contradict a larger story. For example, voters tend to be consistently willing to cut certain aspects of the budget, including the military. But cutting the military is never very popular in Congress. That’s something you don’t always hear about. Americans support the military but they don’t support such a high military budget. It’s a very impressive book. They go through every issue and it’s quantitative – they have a lot of graphs – but they look at every issue seriously on its own terms.</p><p>So the public really is rational?</p><p>That’s what they say. The public can be manipulated, but generally they feel that people have fairly consistent views.</p><p>Why does this happen, people swinging on issues together, at a national level?</p><p>The ideological playing field is already laid out, so it varies. Sometimes an issue will become politicised. Take, for example, attitudes about climate change. That became very politicised – Democrats and Republicans moved in different directions. Most issues are already politicised. Once the politicisation has happened, once the issue has gone through that phase, then everybody tends to move together. You can even think about it in terms of attitudes to Obama. When he was elected, Democrats were very excited about him, and Republicans were sceptical. Independents wanted to give him a chance. Then, after some bad economic years, we have Republicans really detesting him, Independents not liking him – and Democrats not really liking him much either. The interesting thing is that a lot of Democrats say they don’t like Obama because they feel he’s not so liberal, he’s selling out, whereas a lot of Republicans don’t like Obama because they feel he’s an ideologue. I don’t buy either of those claims. What I think is happening is that fundamentally people aren’t liking Obama because they don’t think he’s performing well. They just have different storylines. The Republican storyline for someone who is a Democrat who they don’t like is that he’s an extreme liberal. The Democratic storyline for someone they don’t like is that he’s a weak sell-out. Even though it seems like they’re having opposite reactions, in reality it’s just the same reaction that’s being rationalised. It’s not that people are being irrational, it’s that the reason they give for their attitudes doesn’t always hold up. But the actual attitude is reasonable. Even if people get a lot of the facts wrong – and you can certainly do survey after survey, where you see people getting the facts wrong, and misunderstanding things – it is reasonable to say you’re less supportive of the president after some bad economic times.</p><p>Going back to what we discussed at the beginning, and this trend discussed in books like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X\"><em>What’s</em> <em>the</em> <em>Matter</em> <em>with</em> <em>Kansas</em>?</a> – you really don’t think it’s irrational to vote against your economic interests?</p><p>What’s <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/published/rational_final6.pdf\">rational in voting</a> is not about your own personal economic interests. The main outcome of the election is not what affects you, it’s what affects the entire country. So there’s a lot of evidence that people vote for what they think is good for the country. Of course, if you’re personally unemployed and know a lot of unemployed people, then it makes sense that you will feel that unemployment is a big issue. On the other hand, if you have money in the bank, people are still somehow concerned about inflation. What you consider important problems are certainly impacted by your experiences. But, no, I don’t think it’s a matter of your direct economic interests. I would say it’s indirect.</p><p>By the way, Bob Shapiro wrote an interesting paper in 2009 right after the last election where he <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2009/07/support_for_hea/\">talked about</a> all the problems Obama would have passing healthcare reform. He was right. Everybody thought it would be easy, but he recognised from looking at the survey data, that things in 2009 with Obama were very similar to what they were in 1993 with Bill Clinton. He’s a very clear-eyed observer. He should be the guy on the TV they ask about public opinion, not all these other bozos.</p><p>So here is one of the broader questions I wanted to put to you: Why is America so right wing? Take healthcare, which you just mentioned. Every other developed country in the world has universal healthcare. For wealthy countries, the idea that the government should either provide it or make sure it’s provided is completely uncontroversial. Why is the US different?</p><p>It’s hard to get from point A to point B. It would probably be hard to find many people who would argue that the American healthcare system is better than the French healthcare system, or even the Taiwanese healthcare system. What’s not obvious is how to get there. There are so many interests involved, so much money, so many companies. If they could somehow switch out the US system and switch in this other system – like they have in Taiwan or France – I think that would be wonderful. But it doesn’t seem that that’s considered an option. There are too many people who are doing fine from the current system. The argument made by the opponents of healthcare reform is that it would just be worse if you tried to get to that point from what we already have – we’d have the worst of both worlds. I don’t know if that’s true, but that’s my answer.</p><p>What about the right-wingness of America generally? When you go to America as a European, you begin to feel like Fidel Castro compared with the people around you. Everyone just seems further to the right on all sorts of issues. Do you have any insights into why that is?</p><p>I don’t have a good answer to that. People sometimes say it has to do with geographical divisions. In the United States the lower-income parts of the country tend to be more politically conservative. This happens in other countries too. The idea is that the richer places within a country – or even within a continent like Europe – tend to be more cosmopolitan, more socially liberal and lower-income places tend to be more traditional. Look at a country like Finland – it used to be one of the poorest places in Europe and now it’s one of the richest places. Being richer is associated with more of an open, liberal social attitude. Economics is more complicated. Traditionally, lower-income areas support more economic redistribution. In Europe, for example, the Greeks are lower income and more supportive of redistribution, and the Germans are in the opposite position.</p><p>In the US that was traditionally the case as well. But now the lower-income areas are less supportive of redistribution. This is one of the issues we explore in our book. We don’t have a complete story. Part of it is to do with racial politics. The South changed to the Republican Party, and there were changes that happened in the South – legal changes in the 1960s, where there was redistricting – and rural parts of the South got less representation and the cities and the suburbs got more representation. People from the cities and the suburbs tend to be more conservative on economic issues, and may be a better fit for the national Republican Party.</p><p>Another thing is that the Democratic Party is very reliant on various groups of rich people. Even to the extent that they’re liberal rich people, they’re not extremely liberal economically. They’re very much supportive of free markets. A Silicon Valley millionaire who supports Obama is looking for a Bill Clinton-style economic boom – he’s not looking for some sort of traditional socialist party.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50304\"><div><img title=\"Fire on the Prairie: Chicago&amp;#039;s Harold Washington and the Politics of Race\" alt=\"Image of Fire on the Prairie: Chicago&amp;#039;s Harold Washington and the Politics of Race\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61USIXmkOTL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"106\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"Fire on the Prairie\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">Fire on the Prairie</a></h2><p><a title=\"Fire on the Prairie\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">By Gary Rivlin</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>You mentioned the politics of race. This is a big part of your next book, <em>Fire on the Prairie</em>, about Chicago’s first black mayor. Do you want to tell me a bit about it?</p><p>This is just an amazing story. It’s written by a journalist from Chicago who was clearly very sympathetic to Harold Washington, who was mayor of Chicago in the 1980s. He was an African-American, he’d been a member of Congress, and after the end of the old Daley machine in Chicago he ran for mayor. Actually there are several amazing stories. First that Chicago is a majority white city and he won the Democratic primary election and then the general election. He took advantage of divisions among his opponents. It was a very racist campaign. Washington was saying his opponents were corrupt and that they needed new leadership; his white opponents were saying that he couldn’t be trusted, that he was corrupt and that you should stick with what you have.</p><p>Then, after he became the mayor, there was just this amazing battle. The city council had 50 members and they were divided between supporters of Washington and supporters of his white opponents with a couple inbetween. Over the next couple of years, through a series of deals and elections, Washington and his allies ended up taking control of the council. It wasn’t just about winning the election, but this Stalingrad-type block-by-block battle afterwards. It’s just a very exciting story. And he won. You just don’t expect to see that. They managed to replace this alderman, then they managed to get this person to vote on their side, and eventually they twisted enough arms and did what they needed. Then Washington died of a heart attack.</p><p>It’s a fascinating book because it’s not only about the election but also about the political manoeuvrings. I’m an expert on public opinion and elections but I don’t really have much understanding of political manoeuvrings. In university politics I always managed to piss people off. This is a readable book, very fascinating, and then at the end when he dies, it’s very sad.</p><p>From the reviews I’ve read, it does seem like a bit of a potboiler.</p><p>It’s got good guys and bad guys, and unexpected twists. Washington was a very tough guy. It would have been very tempting for him to just have given up, and say, “Well, I did what I could.” But he didn’t.</p><p>In terms of the politics of race, what do we need to know about how race affects voting in the US?</p><p>At the national level, close to 90% of African-Americans vote for Democrats. For Obama it was about 96%. I think a lot of white people feel Democrats are the black party and don’t support them for that reason.</p><p>This is particularly in the Southern states?</p><p>Yes, though obviously it was also a big deal in Chicago. The assumption has always been that a black candidate could not win most of the white vote, so at first he was just not considered a serious candidate. It was just assumed that white people weren’t going to vote for this guy.</p><p>Were you incredibly surprised when Obama was elected?</p><p>No. He was in the lead, and the economy had not being doing well, so that meant the Democrat would do well. The stronger the partisan cues are, the less important other things are. People do argue about this. Some people claim – which may be true – that Obama maybe didn’t do as well as he would have done if he’d been white. He did about as well as predicted, based on the economy, but he outspent McCain. You could argue that Obama should have done a couple of percentage points better than forecast, because of the unequal campaign. It’s hard to say. People did some surveys where they claimed that some percentage of white people were less likely to vote for Obama because he was black. This kind of thing came up with Romney too. There were some people who said they wouldn’t vote for him because he’s a Mormon. People say all sorts of things in the abstract, but then when it comes to the election, they vote for him. I don’t really believe a lot of these things now, when people say “I won’t do x or y”. They won’t do it right up to the second they do it, and after they do it, they try to explain why it didn’t count.</p><p>These uniform partisan swings you mentioned, don’t they go against the whole notion of increasing partisanship in the US?</p><p>There is increasing partisanship, but it’s something that is happening gradually. Things that are happening in the timescale of a week or a month or a year, are pretty uniform. Long-term, though, the parties have been moving apart. Democrats are more and more distrustful of the Republicans and Republicans are more and more distrustful of the Democrats. So that is happening at the same time. You have the local uniform swings, within the context of the entire topography changing.</p></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><div><blockquote><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50305\"><div><img title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" alt=\"Image of The Emerging Republican Majority\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JYlXJQrLL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"106\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">The Emerging Republican Majority</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">By Kevin P Phillips</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><div><div><blockquote><p>We’ve got to your last book, <em>The Emerging Republican Majority</em>.</p><p>This is by Kevin Phillips. I don’t know his exact job title, but he worked for Richard Nixon. This was a classic book from 1969, about how American politics were changing. The idea was that, partly as a result of the Democrats becoming more uniformly liberal and having more support of blacks, Republicans would soon be able to get the support of various groups of white people, such as urban Catholics, who had traditionally been very strong Democrats. Richard Nixon could get political success, basically, by convincing a lot of white people – not the white people who are traditionally in charge of the country but so-called ethnic white people – that the Democrats were not on their side. Their pitch was that the Republicans were the only truly national party and the Democrats were a sectional party. The Democrats were representing interest groups and only Republicans were representing America. This was seemingly a very successful pitch, and it really mapped a new populism. It wasn’t a new argument. Nixon was making this argument back when he was Joe McCarthy’s buddy in the 1950s. Back then he was already arguing that the Democrats were a bunch of Communists and elitists, but the message didn’t catch on so well in the 1950s. Somehow it became more convincing around 1970 when the economy wasn’t going so well, and when there was a war in Vietnam and fighting in the streets.</p><p>In the last few years Phillips has written some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/American-Theocracy-Politics-Religion-Borrowed/dp/0143038281/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340073762&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=american+theocracy?tag=thebro-21\">very angry books</a>. He really detests George W Bush, basically arguing that the Republicans have been captured by a mixture of rich elites and extreme religious groups. If you look at a book like <em>The Emerging Republican Majority</em>, it’s not about the rich, it’s much more the idea that the Republicans are the sane middle of the country. He became a bit disturbed. This doesn’t discredit the Republicans, the fact that one of their operatives think they went too far. He’s just one guy. But it’s a very important book historically. It’s about a tactic that was actually followed successfully.</p><p>Does it have insights for the present?</p><p>It has insights in terms of how we got to where we are. Looking back, there was no reason to think the Republicans would become this alliance between some very religiously conservative people and these very economically conservative people. It was a different era of what was possible. Various industrialists at the time would have loved to have very low tax rates, but I don’t think it would have been considered possible. There have been big changes in American politics – big moves to the right on economic issues and to the left on social issues.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div><p>Update (2014):</p><p>I still wish I&#8217;d picked a title like Voting by the Numbers or The Secret Life of the American Voter.  &#8220;Red State Blue State&#8221; is catchy but I think it unfortunately gave people the impression that our book was a popularization of existing research rather than a treasure trove of original research itself.</p><p>Meanwhile, the patterns of income and voting within and between states have changed in some ways since the above discussion.

Does [Bayes's] contribution merit the enthusiasms of his followers? Or is his legacy overhyped? . . .</p><p>First, Bayesians appear to have an absolute right to disapprove of any conventional approach in statistics without offering a workable alternative&#8212;for example, a colleague recently stated at a meeting that ‘. . . it is OK to have multiple comparisons because Bayesians’ don’t believe in alpha spending’. . . .</p><p>Second, Bayesians appear to build an army of straw men&#8212;everything it seems is different and better from a Bayesian perspective, although many of the concepts seem remarkably familiar. For example, a very well known Bayesian statistician recently surprised the audience with his discovery of the P value as a useful Bayesian statistic at a meeting in Birmingham.</p><p>Third, Bayesians possess enormous enthusiasm for the Gibbs sampler&#8212;a form of statistical analysis which simulates distributions based on the data rather than solving them directly through numerical simulation, which they declare to be inherently Bayesian&#8212;requiring starting values (priors) and providing posterior distributions (updated priors). However, rather than being of universal application, the Gibbs sampler is really only advantageous in a limited number of situations for complex nonlinear mixed models&#8212;and even in those circumstances it frequently sadly just does not work (being capable of producing quite impossible results, or none at all, with depressing regularity). . . .
</p></blockquote><p>The looks negative, but it you read it carefully, it&#8217;s an extremely pro-Bayesian article!  The key phrase is &#8220;complex nonlinear mixed models.&#8221;  Not too long ago, anti-Bayesians used to say that Bayesian inference was worthless because it only worked on simple linear models.  Now their last resort is to say that it only works for complex nonlinear models!</p><p>OK, it&#8217;s a deal.  I&#8217;ll let the non-Bayesians use their methods for linear regression (as long as there aren&#8217;t too many predictors; then you need a &#8220;complex mixed model&#8221;), and the Bayesians can handle everything complex, nonlinear, and mixed.  Actually, I think that&#8217;s about right.  For many simple problems, the Bayesian and classical methods give similar answers.  But when things start to get complex and nonlinear, it&#8217;s simpler to go Bayesian.</p><p>(As a minor point:   the starting distribution for the Gibbs sampler is not the same as the prior distribution, and also that Freemantle appears to be conflating a computational tool with an approach to inference.  No big deal&#8212;statistical computation does not seem to be <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hs=Hmr&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#038;q=nick%20freemantle&#038;btnG=Search&#038;sa=N&#038;tab=ws\">his area of expertise</a>&#8212;it&#8217;s just funny that he didn&#8217;t run it by an expert before submitting to the journal.)</p><p>Also, I&#8217;m wondering about this &#8220;absolute right to disapprove&#8221; business.   Perhaps Bayesians could file their applications for disapproval through some sort of institutional review board?  Maybe someone in the medical school could tell us when we&#8217;re allowed to disapprove and when we can&#8217;t.</p><p><strong>P.S.</strong></p><p>Yes, yes, I see that the article is satirical.  But, in all seriousness, I do think it&#8217;s a step forward that Bayesian methods are associated with &#8220;complex nonlinear mixed models.&#8221;  That&#8217;s not a bad association to have, since I think complex models are more realistic.  To go back to the medical context, complex models can allow treatments to have different effects in different subpopulations, and can help control for imbalance in observational studies.</p></blockquote><p>Update (2014):</p><p>There&#8217;s something that fascinates me about these aggressive anti-Bayesians:  it&#8217;s not enough for them to simply restrict their own practice to non-Bayesian methods; they have to go the next step and put down Bayesian methods that they don&#8217;t even understand.  This topic comes up from time to time on this blog, for example in discussing the uninformed rants of <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/02/07/philosophy-of-bayesian-statistics-my-reactions-to-hendry/\">David Hendry</a> (&#8220;I don’t know why he did this, but maybe it’s part of some fraternity initiation thing, like TP-ing the dean’s house on Halloween&#8221;), <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2010/06/29/hey_dude_ya_don/\">John DiNardo</a> (&#8220;if philosophy is outlawed, only outlaws will do philosophy&#8221;), and various <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2006/12/20/no_bayesians_in/\">others</a> (the Foxhole <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2009/05/24/handy_statistic/\">Fallacy</a>).</p><p>I was also inspired to write an anti-Bayesian rant of my own (with <a href=\"http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/vol03is03.php\">discussion</a>), and Christian Robert and I considered anti-Bayesianism in the classic probability text of Feller and elsewhere (see the <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/feller8.pdf\">article</a> with <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/fellerip-1.pdf\">discussion</a>).</p><p>Misinformed anti-Bayeisanism doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going away anytime soon, but on the plus side it seems to be moving toward the fringes.  Bayes is here to stay, and I&#8217;m happy to see that <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2013/03/18/tibshirani-announces-new-research-result-a-significance-test-for-the-lasso/\">non-Bayesian regularization</a> is very popular too.</p><p>P.S.  Just to remove any ambiguity here:  I have no problem with <em>non</em>-Bayesians:  those statisticians who for whatever combination of theoretical or applied reasons prefer not to use Bayesian methods in their own work.  My problem is with <em>anti</em>-Bayesians who denigrate the Bayesian approach from a position of lack of understanding.  As noted above, I&#8217;m happy to see that anti-Bayesianism has moved to the fringes, where it belongs.  There&#8217;s always room in any discourse for a few extremists; it&#8217;s just not good if they have a lot of power.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/18/wacky-anti-bayesians/\">Those wacky anti-Bayesians used to be intimidating, but now they&#8217;re just pathetic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/18/wacky-anti-bayesians/feed/") (slash:comments nil "73")) (item nil (title nil "In the best alternative histories, the real world is what’s ultimately real") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/17/best-alternative-histories-real-world-whats-ultimately-real/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/17/best-alternative-histories-real-world-whats-ultimately-real/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 14:52:57 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Causal Inference") (category nil "Literature") (guid ((isPermaLink .

It&#8217;s really creepy.</p><p>And this in turn reminds me of something we discussed here several years ago, the idea that alternative histories are made particularly compelling when they are grounded in the fact that the alternate world is not the real world.  Pourriat&#8217;s video would have been excellent even without its final scene, but that scene drives the point home in a way that I don&#8217;t think would&#8217;ve been possible had the video stayed entirely within its artificial world.</p><p>The point here is that the real world is indeed what is real.  This alternative sex-role-reversed world is not actually possible, and what makes it interesting to think about is the contrast to what really is.  If you set up an alternative history but you don&#8217;t place it in the context of the real world, you&#8217;re missing half the story.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what I <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2005/02/24/contingency_and/\">wrote</a> in 2005:</p><blockquote><p>This might not seem like it has much connection to statistics, but bear with me . . . </p><p>Alternative history&#8212;imaginings of different versions of this world that could have occurred if various key events in the past had been different&#8212;is a popular category of science fiction.  Alternative history stories come in a number of flavors but a common feature of the <em>best</em> of the novels in this subgenre is that the alternate world is not &#8220;real.&#8221;</p><p>Let&#8217;s consider the top three alternative history novels (top three not in sales but in critical reputation, or at least my judgment of literary quality):   <em>The Man in the High Castle, Pavane, and Bring the Jubilee</em>.  (warning:  spoilers coming)
<div class=\"mt-post-excerpt-divider\"></div><p><strong>Three novels</strong></p><p><u>The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick</u>.  In this book, which takes place in a world in which the Allies lost World War II, hints keep peeking through that the world inhabited by the characters is not reality.  Our world is real, and the novel&#8217;s characters are living in a fake world (which is imperfectly perceived by the title character, who is thus so dangerous to those in power).  It’s a more complex twist on the theme of Man out of Joint, but ultimately the same idea:  the people in the novel are living in a fake world which can come apart around them as they recognize that it is a shared illusion.</p><p>Sort of like The Matrix in reverse.  It is a standard theme that our world is fake, there is an underlying truth, etc.  Dick turns this around.  (Actually, I&#8217;ve never seen The Matrix but this is what I&#8217;m imagining it&#8217;s about.)</p><p><u>Pavane by Keith Roberts</u>.  In this classic, the Catholics regained control of England in the 1500s, leading to a much different twentieth-century world.  The backstory, eventually revealed in the novel, is that the masters of our real world had seen the risks of nuclear weapons and had rerun history to give humankind an opportunity to develop without modern science and thus get some more time to figure things out before having to deal with potential species-ending warfare.</p><p><u>Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore</u>, which describes a United States in which the Confederates had won the battle of Gettysburg and then the Civil War.  In this one, the pattern of Pavane is reversed, sort of, in that the original world was the one described in most of the novel (the &#8220;alternative&#8221; history) but then, through some time-traveling mishaps, the story ends up in our reality.</p><p><strong>What does this all mean?</strong></p><p>Is there something we can learn from this, that the very best alternative history novels recognize our world as the real one?  I think so.  Alternate history could be said to have two purposes:  providing insight into our world, and escapism out of it (John Clute makes this point in the Science Fiction Encyclopedia, I believe).  By dividing it that way, I would seem to be damning &#8220;escapism&#8221; and praising &#8220;insight,&#8221; but that is not my point.  Rather, my point is that in either case, the thrill or interest comes from playing off the fact that our world is the real one.  An alternative history that does not recognize the reality of reality can simply &#8220;stack the deck&#8221; and in this sense is less interesting to me than a historical novel, or for that matter, than a pure science fiction novel (which, at some level, has to justify its choices).</p><p>In a sense, all novels are alternate histories, and the issue always arises whether they &#8220;couud have happened.&#8221;  Genre novels such as <em>Mystic River</em> or those of John Le Carre put in a lot of effort to place their stories within convincing backgrounds&#8212;and, in fact, creating these backgrounds is perhaps their main interest.</p><p>I&#8217;d also like to say something about the story &#8220;Forlesen&#8221; by Gene Wolfe, since it&#8217;s so cool, and it presents some sort of alternative history of 20th century America&#8212;but I&#8217;m not really sure what to say, so I won&#8217;t.</p><p><strong>Connections to statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science?</strong></p><p>Causal inference is about potential outcomes, what could have happened.  These potential outcomes should be realistic, and their &#8220;generative models&#8221; should be able to create reality as a reasonable probabilistic prediction.  (That&#8217;s just posterior predictive checking; see chapter 6 of our book.)  Alternative history novels are a way of exploring causal inference in a speculative way.</p></blockquote><p>And <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2006/05/31/alternate_histo/\">see here</a> for a followup a year later from critic John Clute.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/17/best-alternative-histories-real-world-whats-ultimately-real/\">In the best alternative histories, the real world is what&#8217;s ultimately real</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/17/best-alternative-histories-real-world-whats-ultimately-real/feed/") (slash:comments nil "7")) (item nil (title nil "On deck this week:  Revisitings") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/17/week-reruns/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/17/week-reruns/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 13:00:53 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Decision Theory") (guid ((isPermaLink .

For example, they write that &#8220;mutual information is already widely believed to quantify dependencies without bias for relationships of one type or another,&#8221; which seems a bit vague to me.  And later they write, &#8220;How to compute such an estimate that does not bias the resulting mutual information value remains an open problem,&#8221; which seems to me to miss the point in that unbiased statistical estimates are not generally possible and indeed are often not desirable.</p><p>Their criticisms of the MIC measure of Reshef et al. (see above link to that earlier post for background) may well be reasonable, but, again, there are points where they (Kinney and Atwal) may be missing some possibilities.  For example, they write, &#8220;nonmonotonic relationships have systematically reduced MIC values relative to monotonic ones&#8221; and refer to this as a &#8220;bias.&#8221;  But it seems to me that nonmonotonic relationships really are less predictable.  Consider scatterplots A and B of the Kinney and Atwal paper.  The two distributions have the same residual error sd(y|x), but in plot B (the nonmonotonic example) sd(x|y) is much bigger.  Not that sd is necessarily the correct measure&#8212;in my earlier post, I asked what would be the appropriate measure of association between two variables whose scatterplot looked like a circle (that is, y = +/- sqrt(1-x^2)). More generally, I fear that Kinney and Atwal could be painting themselves in a corner if they are defining the strength of association between two variables in terms of the distribution of y given x.  I&#8217;m not so much bothered by the asymmetry as by the implicit dismissal of any smoothness in x.  One could, for example, consider a function where sd(y|x)=0, that is, y is a deterministic function of x, but in a really jumpy way with lots of big discontinuities going up and down.  This to me would be a weaker association than a simple y=a+bx.</p><p>The two papers under discussion differ not just in their methods and assumptions but in their focus.  My impression of Reshef et al. was that they were interested in quickly summarizing pairwise relations in large sets of variables.  In contrast, Kinney and Atwal focus on getting an efficient measure of mutual information for a single pair of variables.  I suppose that Kinney and Atwal could apply their method to a larger structure in the manner of Reshef et al., and I&#8217;d be interested in seeing how it looks.</p><p>I&#8217;d also be interested in a discussion of the idea that the measure of dependence can depend on the scale of discretization, as discussed in my earlier post.</p><p>In any case, lots of good stuff here, and I imagine that different measures of dependence could be useful for different purposes.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/14/maximal-information-coefficient/\">The maximal information coefficient</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/14/maximal-information-coefficient/feed/") (slash:comments nil "23")) (item nil (title nil "An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/13/economists-guide-visualizing-data/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/13/economists-guide-visualizing-data/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 13 Mar 2014 13:15:51 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Economics") (category nil "Statistical graphics") (guid ((isPermaLink .

And I&#8217;ll now admit I was surprised that JEP took the piece without getting Schwabisch to widen his reference points.</p></blockquote><p>To elaborate a bit:  I agree with Schwabish&#8217;s general advice (&#8220;show the data,&#8221; &#8220;reduce the clutter,&#8221; and &#8220;integrate the text and the graph&#8221;).  But then he illustrates with 8 before-and-after stories in which he shows an existing graph and then gives his improvements.  My problem is that I don&#8217;t like most of his &#8220;after&#8221; pictures!</p><p>In just about every case, Swabish&#8217;s advice is reasonable and his graphs improve on the originals.  But I just don&#8217;t think his versions represent best practice.  And, in an influential journal, you&#8217;d like to demonstrate best practice.</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example.  Before:</p><p><img src=\"http://andrewgelman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-11-at-3.43.54-PM-300x215.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-03-11 at 3.43.54 PM\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-23037\" /></p><p>And after:</p><p><img src=\"http://andrewgelman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1b-300x241.png\" alt=\"1b\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-23036\" /></p><p>The small scale and blurriness are my fault; something happened in my cut-and-paste, so please don&#8217;t blame Schwabish for that.</p><p>In any case, yes, the second display is better, but in addition I&#8217;d label the y-axes and, most obviously, I&#8217;d get rid of those heavy gray horizontal lines.  I&#8217;d also put tick marks on the x-axes, especially for the two graphs in the upper row, also he seems to have forgotten to put y-axes on the two graphs on the right.  As it is, the four subgraphs seem to merge into each other.  You really need some visual cues to separate them.</p><p>My other problem with this paper is its lack of ambition.  In each case, an existing graph is redrawn with only slight changes.  But what is really needed in economics, I think, is a larger sense of the importance of graphical discovery.  The excitement of visualization is not conveyed in this article <em>at all</em>.  Rather it all seems like a boring application of certain principles of graphics design.</p><p>I think the article is well-intentioned and may do some good.  And the topic is important.  But I agree with Jenkins:  Schwabish should&#8217;ve taken a broader perspective.  This was a bit of a wasted opportunity.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/13/economists-guide-visualizing-data/\">An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/13/economists-guide-visualizing-data/feed/") (slash:comments nil "21")) (item nil (title nil "More on publishing in journals") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/12/publishing-journals/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/12/publishing-journals/#comments") (pubDate nil "Wed, 12 Mar 2014 14:44:19 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Sociology") (guid ((isPermaLink .

We felt it useful to take our ideas to the next level and write them up as a manuscript, which ended up being logical to split into two papers.  At that point I put some effort into getting these papers published, which I eventually did:  <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/GelmanBasbollAmericanScientist.pdf\">To throw away data: Plagiarism as a statistical crime</a> went into American Scientist and <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/Storytelling_as_Ideology_13.pdf\">When do stories work? Evidence and illustration in the social sciences</a> will appear in Sociological Methods and Research.  The second paper, in particular, took some effort to place; I got some advice from colleagues in sociology as to where to send it (and I think it got rejected from a couple other places first, but now I can&#8217;t remember if I&#8217;m confusing that with some other paper).</p><p>Anyway, here&#8217;s the question:  Why did I go to the (nontrivial) effort of publication?  Why wasn&#8217;t it enough to post the papers on my website and blog them?</p><p>In this case I think it comes down to audience and impact.  American Scientist has a <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/advertise/page/audience-characteristics\">circulation</a> of 73,000.  Not all its readers read evert article, but I&#8217;ve gotta be reaching some people who don&#8217;t see the blog, indeed have never heard of it.</p><p>The circulation of Sociological Methods and Research has to be a lot smaller, so this one&#8217;s a tougher call.  Somehow I feel the article is more &#8220;real&#8221; if it has appeared in a journal.  Is this a reasonable attitude for me to hold?  I&#8217;m not sure.  There&#8217;s something that would bother me about having the article in limbo, not published anywhere.  Ultimately I could stick it in a book, I guess, but I always worry that when I put original ideas in a book that they might not be noticed. (I think that happened a bit with our Red State Blue State book, which contained tons of original research that I fear was ignored because people just assumed the book was a popularization of existing material.)</p><p>So I don&#8217;t know, especially about the SMR paper.  The paper will get some additional readers this way, but I don&#8217;t know if it was worth the effort (indeed, we are still in the copyediting phase; there was some glitch and we haven&#8217;t heard back from the copy editors who I think are in India).  The ultimate win will be if scholars in this area ultimately encounter our work and start thinking differently about the ways in which stories fit into our social science understanding.  For this, publication has the advantage, I think, that people will be more likely to take our arguments seriously once the paper appears &#8220;in print.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Other examples</strong></p><p>I could go on.  I&#8217;ve written many papers that I love but have been a struggle to get published.  For example, my three articles on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics.  These papers express some ideas that have been bugging me for about 20 years.  (I remember yammering on to someone about Bayesian model checking and falsification around 1995, and at that time I&#8217;d already been thinking about these issues for awhile, motivated in large part by disillusioning encounters I&#8217;d had in the early 1990s with Bayesians who&#8217;d just refused to check the fit of their models as a matter of principle.)</p><p>For a long time I&#8217;d wanted to write an article on the topic&#8212;I&#8217;m in the habit of considering &#8220;the article&#8221; as the basic unit of communication&#8212;but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get started.</p><p>Then one day in 2009 I was contacted by Harold Kincaid, the editor of the Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of the Social Sciences, and asked to write an article on Bayesian approaches.  This seemed like a great opportunity to put my ideas down and get them out there.  In particular, writing for a journal is annoying because you have referees looking over your shoulder, whereas edited volumes tend to accept pretty much whatever you send them.  (Not always; last year I was asked to write a chapter for an edited volume (on a completely different topic), and what I sent them wasn&#8217;t quite what they were looking for, and my collaborator and I didn&#8217;t feel like making major revisions.  So that does happen sometimes.)</p><p>Anyway, I wrote this philosophy article and I really liked it, enough so that it seemed worth submitting something to a journal.  I felt the article needed something more, though, as I hadn&#8217;t read anything in the philosophy literature after Lakatos (1970).  So I approached Cosma Shalizi, a person I&#8217;d never met (I think) but who I knew from his writings was interested in the philosophy of statistics.  Cosma added some useful things and we put together a paper, which we got several firm rejections after submission to several statistics journals.  At that point we really weren&#8217;t sure what to do with the paper, but then I was contacted by Thom Baguley, who&#8217;d seen me moan about this on the blog and suggested we submit it to the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, a journal he edited.  And then it eventually appeared with discussion.  I do think all this got our article more attention and gave it some legitimacy, to the extent that maybe our ideas will have broader influence.</p><p><strong>Two papers with Guido</strong></p><p>Next I&#8217;ll discuss two articles that are currently in limbo.  The articles concern econometrics and are in collaboration with Guido Imbens (in both cases because I wrote something that seemed to me to need something more, and I contacted Guido asking if he&#8217;d be interested in collaborating).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/reversecausal_13oct05.pdf\">Why ask why? Forward causal inference and reverse causal questions</a> arose from some things I&#8217;ve been thinking about for many years, concerning how to integrate &#8220;why&#8221; questions into statistical frameworks for causal inference.  The conceptual breakthrough came when I realized that the <em>resolution</em> of a Why question did not have to take the form of an <em>answer</em> to the question.  Guido and I passed this paper back and forth, fixing it up in various ways, then I posted it and it got a lot of attention.  A publisher even contacted Guido and me to see if we&#8217;d like to write a book on the topic.  So the paper got attention.  But, for similar reasons as discussed in the example above, I wanted to publish it in a journal.  We&#8217;re still in the midst of this process.  Responding to reviewer and editor suggestions is definitely making this a better paper, mostly in that we&#8217;re learning ways in which our argument can be misinterpreted, and we&#8217;re getting the opportunity to better connect our ideas to the many literatures on causal inference and statistics.</p><p>The other paper, <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/regression_discontinuity_2.pdf\">Evidence on the deleterious impact of sustained use of polynomial regression on causal inference</a>, derives directly from a blog post.  I think Guido&#8217;s forthcoming contribution on this paper will have a big impact.  As it is, I have an example and some impressions.  I&#8217;m hoping Guido will be able to add the theory that makes this all fit together.  And, again, I don&#8217;t really feel this paper will have its full impact until after it is published in a journal.</p><p><strong>A world without journals?</strong></p><p>Now consider a world in which research journals have disappeared, having been replaced by some sort of beefed-up Arxiv or SSRN (or maybe Plos-One is a better model in that authors would then have to spend a few hundred bucks to defray the cost of organizing review reports).</p><p>Where then would these projects stand?  I&#8217;d write these papers and post them and blog on them, just as before.  I imagine that review would happen much more in a &#8220;post-publication&#8221; or &#8220;during-publication&#8221; sense, in that I&#8217;d post, then get comments, then revise, etc., but the location of the paper would stand in place, rather than moving from preprint to published article.</p><p>What about the larger benefits of exposure and indexing?  In the super-SSRN world, all posted papers would get listed on Google scholar the way published articles do now, so indexing would be no problem.</p><p>But what about exposure?  I&#8217;m on record as hoping that, in the future, organizations such as the Journal of the American Statistical Association or the American Journal of Sociology, will repurpose themselves, changing from publishers to recommendation systems.  Instead of publishing X articles every quarter, or even Y articles every week, the volunteer editorial board of JASA (along with its volunteer referees) will choose X (or maybe 2X) articles every week to promote, out of all the articles appearing that period in this Arxiv/SSRN/Plos-One space.  There could even be a mechanism for &#8220;submitting&#8221; to JASA so they&#8217;d consider promoting the paper.</p><p>I&#8217;ll conclude by discussing how things work now in some fields.</p><p><strong>Statistics</strong><br />
As some commenters noted, statistics is a somewhat decentralized field, which means that applied statisticians such as myself don&#8217;t have much difficulty publishing in journals, as we can choose among various outlets in statistics and applied areas.  Even within statistics, there&#8217;s no clear ranking.  The top journal is JASA, I think&#8212;but others would give the nod to the Annals of Statistics, or maybe Biometrika (although those latter two journals lean toward a no-applied-content rule which restricts their scope).  Then there&#8217;s Biometrics, and the Royal Statistical Society, and also statistics journals in neighboring fields such as Psychometrika,  Econometrica, and JMLR.  Not to mention all the journals in probability theory.  So statistics is not one of those fields where there&#8217;s a clear ranking of top journals.</p><p>On the other side, the transmission of statistics papers is still centered on journal publication.  Various people (including me and, perhaps most notably, Radford Neal) post papers on their websites. Some things go on Arxiv but that&#8217;s a bit of a mixed bag with a lot of good stuff never getting in there.</p><p>And then there&#8217;s books. I don&#8217;t know so much about other fields, but within statistics there&#8217;s been a long history of influential books that fall somewhere between textbooks and research monographs.  Perhaps the best description would be, graduate textbooks containing innovative restructuring of ideas.  Books in this tradition include those of Snedecor, Cochran, Feller, Kish, Cox, McCullagh and Nelder, Tukey, Hastie and Tibshirani, Rasmussen and Williams, and, well, us.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve missed a few, but you get the idea.  For ideas to get disseminated, they just have to get into the influential books, somehow or another.</p><p>The other way our ideas get out there is through software.  Think of all the Bayesian methods being spread through Bugs (or, now, Stan).  Or the influence of lowess, or lasso.  Theory helps too (there are <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/authorship2.pdf\">lots of reasons</a> for a method to be trusted), but my point here is that software implementation is a kind of publication, indeed, one of the best kinds.</p><p><strong>Economics and political science</strong><br />
What about other fields?  Economics seems much more well organized (for better and for worse) than statistics.  They have a few journals that are almost universally agreed to be the best, and it seems that papers published in these places automatically get attention.</p><p>Parallel to this is a network of popular economics bloggers that has no real parallel in any other academic field.  I mean, sure, if I happen to blog a new paper, people will read it, but I&#8217;m just one guy and I don&#8217;t try to cover the field or even all of Bayesian statistics.  In contrast, economics has a bunch of blogs that are a lot more popular than ours and which regularly plug and argue about new published work.</p><p>Political science doesn&#8217;t have this density of blogging but it does have a recognized set of top journals.</p><p>The other thing that helps is that economists and political scientists typically publish less than statisticians, or at least it seems that way to me.  In these social science fields, a paper gets workshopped for awhile before submission, then there can be a grueling review process.  This is a pain in the ass but it does have the effect of reducing the rate at which papers get published.</p><p>Still, a lot of work in social science, especially in policy analysis, never gets published in journals.  There&#8217;s lots of information in Gallup reports, Pew reports, various documents prepared by organizations doing studies in different countries, etc etc.  This stuff gets emailed around but can be hard to find if you don&#8217;t know where to look.</p><p><strong>Psychology</strong><br />
I get the impression that developmental psychology (the subfield in which my sister works) has a somewhat old-fashioned system that still works ok, a sort of genteel tradition in which research claims are understated rather than hyped, and there is a sense of obligation when submitting to the top journals to send in serious papers.  But then there&#8217;s the whole parallel world of &#8220;Psychology Science&#8221;-type papers and the culture clash that arises when people naively think that papers published in that top journal must therefore be of top quality.  Right now the field of psychology is doing a lot of introspection about publication and scientific evidence, and I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p><p><strong>Biology and medicine</strong><br />
Nature, Science, Cell . . . the tabloids.  Big pressure, big money, big dramatic claims, headlines in the New York Times.</p><p>A parallel world of industry-funded studies, so much is published that there are journals that publish nothing but review after review after review of published studies, automated tools for parsing the literature . . .</p><p>I have no idea how to think about this world.</p><p><strong>Physics</strong><br />

But then I got to thinking: what would it <em>really</em> mean to decouple publication from career advancement? This is too late for me&#8212;I’m middle-aged and have no career advancement in my future&#8212;but it got me thinking more carefully about the role of publication in the research process, and this seemed worth a blog (the simplest sort of publication available to me).</p><p>However, somewhere between writing the above paragraphs and writing the blog entry, I forgot exactly what I was going to say!  I guess I should&#8217;ve just typed it all in then.  In the old days I just wouldn&#8217;t run this post, or I&#8217;d postpone it, but my &#8220;on deck this week&#8221; <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/deck-week-things-people-sent/\">feature</a> is serving as a bit of a <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/preregistration-whats/\">preregistration</a>, so I feel I should write <em>something</em> on the topic even if it&#8217;s not as thoughtful or elegant as I was hoping for.</p><p>So, in brief . . . I don&#8217;t need publication for my career but I like to publish things anyway.  Why?  Here are some reasons, in no particular order:<br /><span id=\"more-22967\"></span><br />
1.  Getting more readers.  Sure, more people read this blog than read a typical journal, but with journal publication I might reach some people who don&#8217;t read this blog and don&#8217;t follow Arxiv, for example (not that I usually put my papers on Arxiv, but I probably should, as that&#8217;s a free way to get yet another stream of readers).</p><p>2.  Longer-term readership.  Most blog hits happen on the very first day, and if someone doesn&#8217;t check the blog on the day that some wonderful paper <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/\">appears</a>, they&#8217;re out of luck.  A paper in a journal is sitting there for a long time, it gets cited, linked to on Google scholar, etc etc.  When I write a paper I&#8217;m aiming for lasting impact, not instant attention.</p><p>3.  That feeling of closure.  On another blog, organizational theorist Balazs Kovacs was derided for <a href=\"http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/is-public-intellectual-oxymoronic/\">writing</a> that &#8220;The main reason that I love getting a paper published is that then I can close the process and move on to other new and exciting projects.&#8221;  Setting some of his specific proposals aside, I see where he&#8217;s coming from.  It&#8217;s good to feel that a project is done.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think this is such a good motivation (even though I myself feel it).  When I look back on various 5-year-old or 10-year-old or 20-year-old projects that I just wanted to get done, just to get the projects out of the way, I realize that the final products are not so wonderful and in retrospect maybe they could&#8217;ve been left unpublished.</p><p>4.  That stamp of approval.  The Nuts paper will <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/nuts.pdf\">appear</a> in JMLR.  People can now implement the algorithm themselves if they&#8217;d like, secure in the knowledge that it&#8217;s been vetted by JMLR referees.  OK, the vetting is not always so great&#8212;as we all know, mistakes do get into the published literature.  But from our perspective as the developers of an algorithm, we thought it worth it to put in the effort to get that official status.</p><p>5.  Wikipedia requires a published reference.  This one&#8217;s gonna sound pretty silly, but . . . we wanted to put Stan in Wikipedia.  But to do this we need a published article on Stan.  Not just a published article that <em>uses</em> Stan (believe it or not, these already exist) but an article about Stan.  So Bob wrote <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/stan-resubmit-JSS1293.pdf\">something</a> for JSS.</p><p>6.  Playing the game.  I don&#8217;t need career advancement but students and postdocs do.  So it makes sense to publish for their benefit.  Also I should have some minimum number of publications that I can mention in progress reports for research grants and visiting positions.</p><p>7.  Discussions.  If you publish a discussion paper in a journal you can get thoughtful comments from leaders in the field.  For some examples, go <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published\">here</a> and search on *with discussion*.</p><p>8.  Getting on the agenda.  Nowadays I can do this one more easily by blogging, but in past years, back when journals were printed and appeared in everybody&#8217;s mailbox on a regular basis, the right article at the right time could get a lot of attention.  (The goal, of course, is not the personal attention but rather whatever it takes for people to take the time to look at your paper.)  Every once in awhile this still happens, for example I think the Girolami and Calderhead <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00765.x/full\">paper</a> on RHMC got extra attention for appearing in a journal, compared to just floating around on Arxiv, and a few years back my Struggles with Survey Weighting and Regression Modeling similarly <a href=\"http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1190905511\">appeared</a> in the right place at the right time.</p><p>9.  Responses.  If we see something published that&#8217;s interesting or bothersome, and we have somewhere to go from there (whether it be a criticism, a refutation, or an improvement), we&#8217;d like to publish this in the same place, to reach the people who are (or should) be most interested in the topic.  Unfortunately this is <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics8.pdf\">not always possible</a>, but still I try (although not as hard as <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/01/19/british-amateur-debunked-mathematics-happiness/\">some people do</a>).</p><p>10.  The requirements of publication generally improve a paper.  Not always.  Sometimes there is awkwardness in writing for the reviewers rather than for the readers.  But in most cases we get useful comments from reviewers, and the steps we take to make our papers better can make all the difference.</p><p>Are those reasons enough to go through the bother of publication?  Sometimes.  Often, it seems.  Or maybe I still publish mostly out of habit.</p><p><strong>P.S.</strong>  I think some readers missed the point of this post.  It was not my intent to defend journal publication or the current system of journals.  Rather, I was just trying to lay out, as clearly as possible, my own motivation for continuing to bother submitting papers to journals, given the nontrivial efforts of submissions and revisions and the unclear gains from publication.  I do have some reasons for publishing.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that the current system is so great, I&#8217;m just explaining how I operate within it.</p><p><strong>P.P.S.</strong>  More <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/12/publishing-journals/\">here</a>.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/11/stop-publishing-journals/\">What if I were to stop publishing in journals?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/11/stop-publishing-journals/feed/") (slash:comments nil "52")) (item nil (title nil "Stan Model of the Week:  PK Calculation of IV and Oral Dosing") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/stan-model-pk-iv-oral-dosing/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/stan-model-pk-iv-oral-dosing/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 10 Mar 2014 15:59:45 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Bob Carpenter") (category nil "Bayesian Statistics") (category nil "Stan") (category nil "Statistical computing") (category nil "dosing") (category nil "pharmacokinetic") (category nil "pk") (category nil "R") (guid ((isPermaLink .

I&#8217;ve been following the <a href=\"http://wiekvoet.blogspot.fr/\">Wingvoet blog</a>, the author of which is identified only by the Blogger handle <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/profile/01585623097384646816\">Wingfeet</a>;  a couple of days ago this lovely post came out:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://wiekvoet.blogspot.fr/2014/03/pk-calculation-of-iv-and-oral-dosing-in.html\">PK calculation of IV and oral dosing in JAGS</a></ul><p>Wingfeet&#8217;s post implemented an answer to question 6 from chapter 6 of problem from Rowland and Tozer&#8217;s 2010 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0781750091/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=0781750091&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andrsblog08-20\"><i>Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics</i></a>, Fourth edition, Lippincott, Williams &#038; Wilkins.   </p><p>So in the grand tradition of using this blog to procrastinate, I thought I&#8217;d take a break from C++ coding and paper writing and translate Wingfeet&#8217;s model to Stan.  First, let me repeat Wingfeet&#8217;s model in JAGS, exactly as posted:</p><pre>
  tau <- 1/pow(sigma,2)
  sigma ~ dunif(0,100)
# IV part
  kIV ~dnorm(.4,1)
  cIV ~ dlnorm(1,.01)
  for (i in 1:nIV) {
    predIV[i] <- c0*exp(-k*timeIV[i]) +cIV*exp(-kIV*timeIV[i])
    concIV[i] ~ dnorm(predIV[i],tau)
  }
  c0 <- doseIV/V
  V ~ dlnorm(2,.01)
  k <- CL/V
  CL ~ dlnorm(1,.01)
  AUCIV <- doseIV/CL+cIV/kIV
# oral part
  for (i in 1:nO) {
    predO[i] <- c0star*(exp(-k*timeO[i])-exp(-ka*timeO[i]))
    concO[i] ~ dnorm(predO[i],tau)
  }
  c0star <- doseO*(ka/(ka-k))*F/V
  AUCO <- c0star/k
  F ~ dunif(0,1)
  ka ~dnorm(.4,1)
  ta0_5 <- log(2) /ka
  t0_5 <- log(2)/k
</pre><p>I still find JAGS models pretty hard to follow on their own, but Wingfeet provided the data, and the call to R2Jags, so I could work backwards from there.  Here's what I came up with as a translation to Stan.</p><pre>

model {

  kIV ~ normal(0.4, 1);
  cIV ~ lognormal(1,10);

</pre><p>Do I ever appreciate the emacs mode for Stan!  The Stan model is a direct translation of Wingfeet's JAGS model, with exactly the same priors (Stan uses a sd parameterization of the normal, whereas JAGS follows bugs in using inverse variance).  I moved all the deterministic nodes in the JAGS model to the transformed parameters block in the Stan model so we could inspect them in the output.  I also vectorized the prediction calculations, which seems much cleaner than using loops, but opinions may vary on this point.</p><p>It was critical to put the lower-bounds on all the concentration and volume parameters in Stan, as well as upper and lower bounds on the noise term (which had a broad uniform distribution in the JAGS model). </p><p>Here's the data in Stan's dump format, which I dropped in a file named <code>data.R</code>:</p><pre>

Then he does it. If he finds something interesting, he writes it up as a paper, citing that tweet or post as his preregistration. . . .</p></blockquote><p>I think this approach has some benefits but doesn’t really address the issues of preregistration that concern me&#8212;but I’d like to spend an entire blog post explaining why.  I have two key points:</p><p>1.  If your study is crap, preregistration might fix it.  Preregistration is fine&#8212;indeed, the wide acceptance of preregistration might well motivate researchers to not do so many crap studies&#8212;but it doesn&#8217;t solve fundamental problems of experimental design.</p><p>2.  &#8220;Preregistration&#8221; seems to mean different things in different scenarios:</p><p>A.  When the concern is multiple comparisons (as most notoriously in that Bem ESP study), &#8220;preregistration&#8221; would require completely specifying&#8212;before the data are collected&#8212;the experimental design, data collection protocols, data exclusion rules, and selecting ahead of time the comparisons to be performed and the details of the statistical analysis.</p><p>B.  When the concern is the file drawer (the idea that Gelman or some other researcher performs lots of studies, and we want to hear about the failures as well as successes), &#8220;preregistration&#8221; is a &#8220;bare bones summary&#8221; that can be tweeted.</p><p>I think we can all agree that Preregistration A and Preregistration B are two different things.  There&#8217;s no way I could specify all my data processing and analysis decisions for a study, in only 140 characters!</p><p>Neither my point 1 or point 2 is an argument <em>against</em> preregistration!  Sure, preregistration doesn&#8217;t solve problems of experimental design. It doesn&#8217;t cure cancer either, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s useless.  But I think it&#8217;s important to be clear what sort of preregistration we&#8217;re talking about in any particular case, and what we expect preregistration to be doing.</p><p><strong>1.  Preregistration is fine but it doesn&#8217;t solve your problem if studies are sloppy, variation is high, and effects are small&#8212;especially if you try to study within-person effects using between-person designs</strong></p><p>Neuroskeptic has a more recent <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2014/03/04/women-hormonal-vote/\">post</a> expressing a noncommittal view of the claim that hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle impact political and religious beliefs.  Given that political science is (I assume) not among Neuroskeptic&#8217;s areas of expertise, I respect his or her decision to hold off judgment on the issue.  However, given that this is an area of <em>my</em> expertise, I can assure Neuroskeptic that the original published claim on this topic is indeed (a) unsupported by the researchers&#8217; data, because of reasons of multiple comparisons (see <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf\">here</a>) for much discussion, and (b) extremely implausible given what we know about the stability of public opinion, especially in recent elections.  Of this study and a recent nonreplication, Neuroskeptic writes:</p><blockquote><p>I know of only one way to put a stop to all this uncertainty: preregistration of studies of all kinds. It won’t quell existing worries, but it will help to prevent new ones, and eventually the truth will out.</p></blockquote><p>I think this is overstated and way too optimistic.  In the case of the ovulation-and-voting study, the authors have large measurement error, high levels of variation, and they&#8217;re studying small effects.  And all this is made even worse because they are studying within-person effects using a between-person design.  So any statistically significant difference they find is likely to be in the wrong direction and is essentially certain to be a huge overestimate.  That is, the design has <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/retropower.pdf\">a high Type S error rate and a high Type M error rate</a>.</p><p><strong>2.  Should I preregister my research?</strong></p><p>As I wrote above, the question is not just <em>if</em> I should preregister but also <em>how</em> I should do it.</p><p>I do think that blogging my research directions ahead of time (or archiving time-stamped statements, if I want to let my ideas develop in secret for awhile) would be a good idea.  It would give people a sense of what worked, what didn&#8217;t work, and what I&#8217;m still working on.  In many ways I do a lot of this already&#8212;blogging my half-formed thoughts which, years later, turn into papers&#8212;but I can see the argument for doing this more formally.</p><p>But this sort of blogging would not address multiple comparisons problems.  For example, if Bem had tweeted ahead of time that he was doing an ESP study and focusing on prediction of sexual images, or if Beall and Tracy had tweeted ahead of time that hey were investigating the hypothesis that that fertile women were more likely to wear red, no, in neither cases would that have been enough.  In both cases, there were just too many data-processing and data-analysis choices that would not fit in that research plan.</p><p>So, what about the full preregistration?  Not what goes in a tweet but a complete step-by-step plan of how I would choose, code, and analyze the data?  That might have been a good idea for Bem, Beall, and Tracy, or maybe not, but it would certainly not work for me in my political science research (or, for that matter, in my research in statistical methods).  Many of my most important applied results were interactions that my colleagues and I noticed only after spending a lot of time with our data.</p><p>Just to be clear: you can see that I&#8217;m not disagreeing with Neuroskeptic.  He or she suggested that I do tweet-like announcements of my research plans, and I agree that&#8217;s a good idea.  It&#8217;s just not the same as preregistration, at least not as commonly understood.</p><p>P.S.  <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/mock.pdf\">This discussion</a> published last year is relevant too.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/preregistration-whats/\">Preregistration: what’s in it for you?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/preregistration-whats/feed/") (slash:comments nil "44")) (item nil (title nil "On deck this week:  Things people sent me") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/deck-week-things-people-sent/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/10/deck-week-things-people-sent/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 10 Mar 2014 13:00:18 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Decision Theory") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Here’s one <a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/html/7_3_urbanities-new_class.html\">from 1997</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not sure I’d like to be one of the people featured on the New York Times wedding page, but I know I’d like to be the father of one of them. Imagine how happy Stanley J. Kogan must have been, for example, when his daughter Jamie got into Yale. Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.</p><p>And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man—Thomas Arena—who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .</p><p>These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan’s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.</p></blockquote><p>Brooks is reputed to be Jewish himself so I think it’s ok for him to mock Jewish people in print.  The urologist bit . . . well, hey, I’m <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/09/05/two-exciting-movie-ideas-second-chance-u-and-the-new-dirty-dozen/#comment-99297\">not above</a> a bit of bathroom humor myself—and nor, for that matter, is the great Dave Barry—so I can hardly fault a columnist for finding a laugh where he can.</p><p>The interesting part, though, comes near the end of the column:</p><blockquote><p>The members of the cognitive elite will work their way up into law partnerships or top jobs at the New York Times, but they probably won’t enter the billionaire ranks. The real wealth will go to the risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in middle- or lower-middle-class homes and got no help from their non-professional parents when they went off to college.</p></blockquote><p>One of the fun things about revisiting old journalism is that we can check how the predictions come out.  So let’s examine the two claims above, 17 years later:</p><p>1.  “The members of the cognitive elite . . . probably won’t enter the billionaire ranks.”  Check.  No problem there.  Almost nobody is a billionaire, so, indeed, most people with graduate degrees who are featured in the NYT wedding section do not become billionaires.</p><p>2.  “The real wealth will go to the risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in middle- or lower-middle-class homes and got no help from their non-professional parents when they went off to college.”  Hmmm . . . I googled rich people and found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Forbes_400\">this</a> convenient wikipedia list of members of the Forbes 400.  Let’s go through them in order:</p><p>Bill Gates<br />
Warren Buffett<br />
Larry Ellison<br />
Charles Koch<br />
David H. Koch<br />
Christy Walton<br />
Jim Walton<br />
Alice Walton<br />
S. Robson Walton<br />
Michael Bloomberg<br />
Sheldon Adelson<br />
Jeff Bezos<br />
Larry Page<br />
Sergey Brin<br />
Forrest Mars, Jr.</p><p>Most of these had backgrounds far above the middle class.  For example, of Gates, “His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way.”  Here’s Buffett:  “Buffett’s interest in the stock market and investing also dated to his childhood, to the days he spent in the customers’ lounge of a regional stock brokerage near the office of his father’s own brokerage company.”  Koch:  “After college, Koch started work at Arthur D. Little, Inc. In 1961 he moved back to Wichita to join his father’s business, Rock Island Oil & Refining Company.”  And I don’t think I have to tell you about the backgrounds of the Waltons or Forrest Mars, Jr.  Larry Page had more of a middle class background but not the kind that David Brooks was looking for:  “His father, Carl Page, earned a Ph.D. in computer science in . . . and is considered a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence. Both he and Page’s mother, Gloria, were computer science professors at Michigan State University.”  And here’s Sergei Brin:  “His father is a mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.”  Damn!  Foiled again.  They might have even <em>really</em> violated Brooks’s rule and paid for Brin’s college education.</p><p>That leaves us with Larry Ellison, Sheldon Adelson, Michael Bloomberg, and Jeff Bezos:  4 out of the Forbes 15.  So, no, I think Brooks would’ve been more prescient had he written:</p><blockquote><p>The real wealth will go to the heirs of rich people or to risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in rich or upper-class homes or who grew up middle class but got lots of help from their well-educated professional parents when they went off to college and graduate school.</p></blockquote><p>But that wouldn’t have sounded as good.  It would’ve been like <a href=\"http://www.phillymag.com/articles/booboos-in-paradise/\">admitting</a> that the surf-and-turf at Red Lobster actually cost more than $20.  As Sasha Issenberg reported back in 2006:</p><blockquote><p>I went through some of the other instances where he [Brooks] made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being “too pedantic,” of “taking all of this too literally,” of “taking a joke and distorting it.” “That’s totally unethical,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>This time, let me make it clear that I’m not saying that Brooks did any false reporting. He just made a prediction in 1997 that was way way off.  I do think Brooks showed poor statistical or sociological judgment, though.  To think that “the real wealth” will go to the children of the “middle- or lower-middle-class” who don’t even pay for their college education . . . that’s just naiveté or wishful thinking at best or political propaganda at worst.</p><p>Brooks follows up his claim with this bizarre (to me) bit of opinionizing:</p><blockquote><p>The people on the New York Times wedding page won’t make $4 million a year like the guy who started a chain of erotic car washes. They’ll have to make do with, say, $1.2 million if they make partner of their law firms. Maybe even less.

According to Brooks’s ideology (which he seems to have borrowed from Tom Wolfe), “the guy who started a chain of erotic car washes” is a good guy, and “the cognitive elite” are bad guys.  One way you can see this is that the erotic car wash guy is delightfully unpretentious (he might, for example have season tickets to the local football team and probably has a really big house and and a bunch of cars and boats, and he probably eats a lot of fat steaks too), while the cognitive elite have an “unceasing desire to demonstrate their social superiority.”  They’re probably Jewish, too, just like that unfortunate urologist from the first paragraph of Brooks’s article.</p><p>But the thing that puzzles me is . . . isn’t 1.2 million a year <em>enough</em>?

Here&#8217;s one <a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/html/7_3_urbanities-new_class.html\">from 1997</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d like to be one of the people featured on the New York Times wedding page, but I know I&#8217;d like to be the father of one of them. Imagine how happy Stanley J. Kogan must have been, for example, when his daughter Jamie got into Yale. Then imagine his pride when Jamie made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. . . . he must have enjoyed a gloat or two when his daughter put on that cap and gown.</p><p>And things only got better. Jamie breezed through Stanford Law School. And then she met a man&#8212;Thomas Arena&#8212;who appears to be exactly the sort of son-in-law that pediatric urologists dream about. . . .</p><p>These two awesome resumes collided at a wedding ceremony . . . It must have been one of the happiest days in Stanley J. Kogan&#8217;s life. The rest of us got to read about it on the New York Times wedding page.</p></blockquote><p>Brooks is reputed to be Jewish himself so I think it&#8217;s ok for him to mock Jewish people in print.  The urologist bit . . . well, hey, I&#8217;m <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/09/05/two-exciting-movie-ideas-second-chance-u-and-the-new-dirty-dozen/#comment-99297\">not above</a> a bit of bathroom humor myself&#8212;and nor, for that matter, is the great Dave Barry&#8212;so I can hardly fault a columnist for finding a laugh where he can.</p><p>The interesting part, though, comes near the end of the column:</p><blockquote><p>The members of the cognitive elite will work their way up into law partnerships or top jobs at the New York Times, but they probably won&#8217;t enter the billionaire ranks. The real wealth will go to the risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in middle- or lower-middle-class homes and got no help from their non-professional parents when they went off to college.</p></blockquote><p>One of the fun things about revisiting old journalism is that we can check how the predictions come out.  So let&#8217;s examine the two claims above, 17 years later:</p><p>1.  &#8220;The members of the cognitive elite . . . probably won&#8217;t enter the billionaire ranks.&#8221;  Check.  No problem there.  Almost nobody is a billionaire, so, indeed, most people with graduate degrees who are featured in the NYT wedding section do not become billionaires.</p><p>2.  &#8220;The real wealth will go to the risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in middle- or lower-middle-class homes and got no help from their non-professional parents when they went off to college.&#8221;  Hmmm . . . I googled rich people and found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Forbes_400\">this</a> convenient wikipedia list of members of the Forbes 400.  Let&#8217;s go through them in order:</p><p>Bill Gates<br />
Warren Buffett<br />
Larry Ellison<br />
Charles Koch<br />
David H. Koch<br />
Christy Walton<br />
Jim Walton<br />
Alice Walton<br />
S. Robson Walton<br />
Michael Bloomberg<br />
Sheldon Adelson<br />
Jeff Bezos<br />
Larry Page<br />
Sergey Brin<br />
Forrest Mars, Jr.</p><p>Most of these had backgrounds far above the middle class.  For example, of Gates, &#8220;His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s Buffett:  &#8220;Buffett&#8217;s interest in the stock market and investing also dated to his childhood, to the days he spent in the customers&#8217; lounge of a regional stock brokerage near the office of his father&#8217;s own brokerage company.&#8221;  Koch:  &#8220;After college, Koch started work at Arthur D. Little, Inc. In 1961 he moved back to Wichita to join his father&#8217;s business, Rock Island Oil &#038; Refining Company.&#8221;  And I don&#8217;t think I have to tell you about the backgrounds of the Waltons or Forrest Mars, Jr.  Larry Page had more of a middle class background but not the kind that David Brooks was looking for:  &#8220;His father, Carl Page, earned a Ph.D. in computer science in . . . and is considered a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence. Both he and Page&#8217;s mother, Gloria, were computer science professors at Michigan State University.&#8221;  And here&#8217;s Sergei Brin:  &#8220;His father is a mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother a researcher at NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center.&#8221;  Damn!  Foiled again.  They might have even <em>really</em> violated Brooks&#8217;s rule and paid for Brin&#8217;s college education.</p><p>That leaves us with Larry Ellison, Sheldon Adelson, Michael Bloomberg, and Jeff Bezos:  4 out of the Forbes 15.  So, no, I think Brooks would&#8217;ve been more prescient had he written:</p><blockquote><p>The real wealth will go to the heirs of rich people or to risk-taking entrepreneurs who grew up in rich or upper-class homes or who grew up middle class but got lots of help from their well-educated professional parents when they went off to college and graduate school.</p></blockquote><p>But that wouldn&#8217;t have sounded as good.  It would&#8217;ve been like <a href=\"http://www.phillymag.com/articles/booboos-in-paradise/\">admitting</a> that the surf-and-turf at Red Lobster actually cost more than $20.  As Sasha Issenberg reported back in 2006:</p><blockquote><p>I went through some of the other instances where he [Brooks] made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being “too pedantic,” of “taking all of this too literally,” of “taking a joke and distorting it.” “That&#8217;s totally unethical,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>This time, let me make it clear that I&#8217;m not saying that Brooks did any false reporting. He just made a prediction in 1997 that was way way off.  I do think Brooks showed poor statistical or sociological judgment, though.  To think that &#8220;the real wealth&#8221; will go to the children of the &#8220;middle- or lower-middle-class&#8221; who don&#8217;t even pay for their college education . . . that&#8217;s just naiveté or wishful thinking at best or political propaganda at worst.</p><p>Brooks follows up his claim with this bizarre (to me) bit of opinionizing:</p><blockquote><p>The people on the New York Times wedding page won&#8217;t make $4 million a year like the guy who started a chain of erotic car washes. They&#8217;ll have to make do with, say, $1.2 million if they make partner of their law firms. Maybe even less. The cognitive elite have more status but less money than the millionaire entrepreneurs, and their choices as consumers reflect their unceasing desire to demonstrate their social superiority to people richer than themselves.</p></blockquote><p>I honestly can&#8217;t figure out what he&#8217;s getting at here except that I think it&#8217;s a bit of &#8220;mood affiliation,&#8221; as Tyler Cowen might say.  According to Brooks&#8217;s ideology (which he seems to have borrowed from Tom Wolfe), &#8220;the guy who started a chain of erotic car washes&#8221; is a good guy, and &#8220;the cognitive elite&#8221; are bad guys.

You can see this in the progression from his first book to his latest. (Criticizing bad work is important too, but you’ll have to read his early books to find more of that. He won’t spend as much time talking about it in his course.) That reminded me of Jesse Robbins’ line: “Don’t fight stupid. You are better than that.

In this case, I’m part of an informal “club” of critics (Simonsohn, Francis, Ioannidis, Nosek, etc etc), but, again, it seems that criticism of bad work can be a helpful way of moving forward and thinking harder about how to do good work.</p><p>It’s funny, though. In my blog and in my talks, I talk about stuff I like and stuff I don’t like. But in my books, just about all my examples are positive.

And I don&#8217;t think I could&#8217;ve got there without starting with criticism.</p><p>(<a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2011/08/29/infovis-infographics-and-data-visualization-where-im-coming-from-and-where-id-like-to-go/\">Here&#8217;s a blog post from 2011</a> where I explain where I&#8217;m coming from on the graphics criticism.  See also <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2013/05/09/a-tale-of-two-discussion-papers/\">here</a> for a slightly broader discussion of the difficulties of communication across different research perspectives.)</p><p>A similar pattern seems to be occurring in my recent series of criticisms of &#8220;Psychological Science&#8221;-style research papers.  In this case, I&#8217;m part of an informal &#8220;club&#8221; of critics (Simonsohn, Francis, Ioannidis, Nosek, etc etc), but, again, it seems that criticism of bad work can be a helpful way of moving forward and thinking harder about how to do good work.</p><p>It’s funny, though. In my blog and in my talks, I talk about stuff I like and stuff I don’t like. But in my books, just about all my examples are positive. We have very few negative examples, really none at all that I can think of (except for some of the examples in the “lying with statistics” chapter in the Teaching Statistics book). This suggests that I’m doing something different in my books than in my blogs and lectures.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/02/negative/\">Am I too negative?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/02/negative/feed/") (slash:comments nil "18"))) ("Association for Psychological Science announces a new journal" "<p><img src=\"http://andrewgelman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/spec.png\" alt=\"spec\" width=\"149\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23117\" /></p><p>The Association for Psychological Science, the leading organization of research psychologists, announced a long-awaited new journal, <a href=\"http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/journals/speculations\">Speculations on Psychological Science</a>.

Rather than trying to isolate a single causal path, consider different cases of forward casual inference.  My guess is that the different stories regarding moderators etc. could motivate different thought experiments (and, ultimately, different observational studies) regarding different potential interventions.</p><p>So I would not try to &#8220;adjudicate&#8221; between different stories; rather, I&#8217;d recognize that they could all be appropriate, just corresponding to different interventions.

If I succeed in raising doubts about something in the minds of many readers, then that’s obviously something an author should take seriously. The point is that an author has a responsibility to the readership of the paper, not any one critic.</p></blockquote><p>I agree that the ultimate audience is the scholarly community (and, beyond that, the general public) and that the critic is just serving as a conduit, the person who poses the Q in the Q-and-A.</p><p>That said, I get frustrated frustrated frustrated when people don’t respond to questions and criticisms from me.  This frustration comes in various flavors.  Perhaps most unreasonable (from my part) is that after I slammed Gregg Easterbrook for an incompetent political column, his editors at Reuters made most of the corrections I suggested (including the links I’d supplied) but without <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2011/10/20/a-note-to-gregg-easterbrooks-editor-at-reuters/\">acknowledging</a> me in any way.  I still think I was in the right here (it’s only common courtesy to acknowledge the source of your information), but ultimately the information got out there.</p><p>I got more <a href=\"http://www.symposium-magazine.com/sorry-wrong-number-andrew-gelman/\">frustrated</a> after Arthur Brooks garbled some poll data on happiness and David Brooks mainstreamed some anti-Semitic fake stats, with both these errors coming on the New York Times op-ed page.  What frustrated me was not the erroneous numbers—after all, I make mistakes too!—but rather the decisions by the writers (and their editors) not to run corrections, even after the errors were pointed out repeatedly, by myself and others.  (Indeed, in neither case was I the one to the discover the mistake; it was other people who pointed these cases out to me, and then I explored them further.)  I keep coming back to these examples partly because I think the two Brookses can do better:  both of them seem to me to be serious, thoughtful people would like to use their writings to have impact on the world.  In David Brooks’s case in particular, I hate to see him take the dark path of disseminating what is at best sloppy research and what is at worst disinformation, just because it happens to align in some ways with his political views.</p><p>Or take the case Basbøll is talking about, a paper that recently appeared in a journal of business management.  The paper got some favorable publicity, the editor of the journal promoted the paper in a blog, and then the paper came in for some serious criticism.  The consensus (at least to me) seems to be that the paper is reasonable if a bit overstated in its conclusions, not quite as good as the journal editor claimed but making a real, if specific, contribution to the literature.  But during the discussion some of the commenters were called out as “trolls.”  My point:  the “trolling” seemed to be necessary to move the scholarly and scientific discussion forward.  Had everyone been super-polite, the journal editor could’ve just remained in a state of complacency about the paper, but instead the strong comments motivated him and the authors of the paper to respond.</p><p>There’s also a sense of symmetry, a fight-trolling-with-trolling syndrome.  For example, I’ve occasionally written about a sociologist who’s written a series of papers about sex roles and sex ratios of babies.  I’d call this guy a science troll.  He makes provocative claims based on very weak data and gets lots of attention making “politically incorrect” statements which would be unremarkable if overheard at the local bar or country club but get attention because of their purported scientific basis.</p><p>Or consider the recent “Psychological Science”-style papers by various authors that we’ve been discussing during the past year on this blog.  I think they too often represent trolling, of a sort, getting attention based on politically loaded claims which are basically unsupported by data.  And are unsupported by theory too, in the sense that their theories are vague enough to explain just about any pattern they see—or its opposite.</p><p>Just to be clear, I wouldn’t label the administrative science paper discussed above as trolling.

If I succeed in raising doubts about something in the minds of many readers, then that&#8217;s obviously something an author should take seriously. The point is that an author has a responsibility to the readership of the paper, not any one critic.</p></blockquote><p>I agree that the ultimate audience is the scholarly community (and, beyond that, the general public) and that the critic is just serving as a conduit, the person who poses the Q in the Q-and-A.</p><p>That said, I get frustrated frustrated frustrated when people don&#8217;t respond to questions and criticisms from me.  This frustration comes in various flavors.  Perhaps most unreasonable (from my part) is that after I slammed Gregg Easterbrook for an incompetent political column, his editors at Reuters made most of the corrections I suggested (including the links I&#8217;d supplied) but without <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2011/10/20/a-note-to-gregg-easterbrooks-editor-at-reuters/\">acknowledging</a> me in any way.  I still think I was in the right here (it&#8217;s only common courtesy to acknowledge the source of your information), but ultimately the information got out there.</p><p>I got more <a href=\"http://www.symposium-magazine.com/sorry-wrong-number-andrew-gelman/\">frustrated</a> after Arthur Brooks garbled some poll data on happiness and David Brooks mainstreamed some anti-Semitic fake stats, with both these errors coming on the New York Times op-ed page.  What frustrated me was not the erroneous numbers&#8212;after all, I make mistakes too!&#8212;but rather the decisions by the writers (and their editors) not to run corrections, even after the errors were pointed out repeatedly, by myself and others.  (Indeed, in neither case was I the one to the discover the mistake; it was other people who pointed these cases out to me, and then I explored them further.)  I keep coming back to these examples partly because I think the two Brookses can do better:  both of them seem to me to be serious, thoughtful people would like to use their writings to have impact on the world.  In David Brooks&#8217;s case in particular, I hate to see him take the dark path of disseminating what is at best sloppy research and what is at worst disinformation, just because it happens to align in some ways with his political views.</p><p>Or take the case Basbøll is talking about, a paper that recently appeared in a journal of business management.  The paper got some favorable publicity, the editor of the journal promoted the paper in a blog, and then the paper came in for some serious criticism.  The consensus (at least to me) seems to be that the paper is reasonable if a bit overstated in its conclusions, not quite as good as the journal editor claimed but making a real, if specific, contribution to the literature.  But during the discussion some of the commenters were called out as &#8220;trolls.&#8221;  My point:  the &#8220;trolling&#8221; seemed to be necessary to move the scholarly and scientific discussion forward.  Had everyone been super-polite, the journal editor could&#8217;ve just remained in a state of complacency about the paper, but instead the strong comments motivated him and the authors of the paper to respond.</p><p>There&#8217;s also a sense of symmetry, a fight-trolling-with-trolling syndrome.  For example, I&#8217;ve occasionally written about a sociologist who&#8217;s written a series of papers about sex roles and sex ratios of babies.  I&#8217;d call this guy a science troll.  He makes provocative claims based on very weak data and gets lots of attention making &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; statements which would be unremarkable if overheard at the local bar or country club but get attention because of their purported scientific basis.</p><p>Or consider the recent &#8220;Psychological Science&#8221;-style papers by various authors that we&#8217;ve been discussing during the past year on this blog.  I think they too often represent trolling, of a sort, getting attention based on politically loaded claims which are basically unsupported by data.  And are unsupported by theory too, in the sense that their theories are vague enough to explain just about any pattern they see&#8212;or its opposite.</p><p>Just to be clear, I wouldn&#8217;t label the administrative science paper discussed above as trolling.  It&#8217;s a bit of narrow research with broader implications.  Which I like a lot; it&#8217;s the &#8220;tabletop model&#8221; of social science.</p><p>I&#8217;m just pointing out that, in our discussion of flaws in published papers, we are in many ways living in a world whose parameters are set by scientific publishing and the news media, a world in which the most prestigious scientific journals are known as &#8220;the tabloids.&#8221;  A landscape of trolls.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/27/beyond-valley-trolls/\">Beyond the Valley of the Trolls</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/27/beyond-valley-trolls/feed/") (slash:comments nil "16"))) ("New research journal on observational studies" "<p>Dylan Small writes:</p><blockquote><p>I am starting an <a href=\"http://obsstudies.org\">observational studies journal</a> that aims to publish papers on all aspects of observational studies, including study protocols for observational studies, methodologies for observational studies, descriptions of data sets for observational studies, software for observational studies and analyses of observational studies.

A graph with two or three lines (labeled directly, not with a legend, please!) allows comparisons across each line and between lines.  I’ve found this to be amazingly effective.</p><p>- You are the first audience for your graphs.  I don’t see a big difference between exploratory graphics and presentation graphics.  When I make graphics for myself, I make them (roughly) presentation quality:  I make them in pdf, give titles and axis labels, grids of graphs, etc.</p><p>- Statistical graphics is commonly presented as being exploratory and about plotting the raw data.  I think that’s important, no doubt about it, and I don’t do enough of it.  In particular, I need better tools for data cleaning.  But, in addition, beyond data exploration, graphics is important for understanding the models we have fit, so I also like the term “exploratory model analysis.&#8221;</p><p>- I’ve only very rarely made dynamic graphs (oddly enough, the only one I can think of offhand, I made for a research project in 1989 and never published or even showed it to anyone else, I think).  This is not a brag.  I think dynamic graphics have great potential.  I just want to be honest about my limitations.  When teaching, it’s good to give the students a good sense of the areas I <em>don’t</em> know about, to help them better map the territory relative to my course material.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/25/statistical-graphics-course-statistical-graphics-advice/\">A statistical graphics course and statistical graphics advice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/25/statistical-graphics-course-statistical-graphics-advice/feed/") (slash:comments nil "28"))) ("Empirical implications of Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models" "<p><img src=\"http://andrewgelman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/jane-goodall-615-300x191.jpg\" alt=\"jane-goodall-615\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-23026\" /></p><p>Robert Bloomfield writes:</p><blockquote><p>Most of the people in my field (accounting, which is basically applied economics and finance, leavened with psychology and organizational behavior) use ‘positive research methods’, which are typically described as coming to the data with a predefined theory, and using hypothesis testing to accept or reject the theory’s predictions.

According to the above quote, his marginal tax rate is currently 80% but threatens to rise to 90%.</p><p>But, in October 2008, Mankiw <a href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/10/blog-post.html\">calculated</a> that Obama’s would tax his marginal dollar at 93%.  What we’re saying, then, is that Mankiw’s marginal tax rate is currently thirteen percentage points lower than he’d anticipated two years ago.  In fact, Mankiw’s stated current marginal tax rate of 80% is three points lower than the tax rate he expected to pay under a McCain administration!  And if the proposed new tax laws are introduced, Mankiw’s marginal tax rate of 90% is <em>still</em> three percentage points lower than he’d anticipated, back during the 2008 election campaign.  I assume that, for whatever reason, Obama did not follow through on all his tax-raising promises.</p><p>To frame the numbers more dramatically:  According to Mankiw’s calculations, he is currently keeping <em>almost three times</em> the proportion of his income that he was expecting to keep under the Obama administration (and 18% more than he was expecting to keep under a hypothetical McCain administration).  If the new tax plans are put into effect, Mankiw will still keep 43% more of his money than he was expecting to keep, only two years ago.  (For those following along at home, the calculations are (1-0.80)/(1-0.93)=2.9, (1-0.80)/(1-0.83)=1.18, and (1-0.90)/(1-0.93)=1.43.)</p><p>Given that Mankiw currently gets to keep 20% of his money—rather than the measly 7% he was anticipating—it’s no surprise that he’s still working!</p><p><strong>Now, the bad news</strong></p><p>I don’t think Mankiw has fully thought this through.
<div class=\"mt-post-excerpt-divider\"></div><p>He writes as if he’s writing newspaper articles for the money.  (“Now you might not care if I supply less of my services to the marketplace—although, because you are reading this article, you are one of my customers.”)  I don’t believe it.  I think he’s writing the articles because he has views that he thinks are important and he wants to share them with the world.  Like blogging, but with more readers.  As you all know, we blog for free.  And, for people like Mankiw (or even me), when we write newspaper articles it’s pretty much for free too. There are a lot easier ways for us to make $1000 than to write an article for the newspaper.  From a financial standpoint, the only reason to do it is that we were already planning to write the article for free.</p><p>In which case, the marginal tax rate doesn’t have anything to do with it.  Sure, it’s fun to get these little checks—just the other day, I received a bank deposit from the Wall Street Journal for an article they <em>didn’t</em> publish—but let’s not kid ourselves that we’re doing it for the money, or even for our kids (who I think will do just fine without that extra $1000 in their inheritance).</p><p><strong>What Mankiw could do with the money</strong></p><p>The last time this came up, a couple of years ago, Mankiw wrote the following in response to Obama’s threatened 93% marginal tax rate:</p><blockquote><p>The bottom line: If you are one of those people out there trying to induce me [Mankiw] to do some work for you, there is a good chance I will turn you down. And the likelihood will go up after President Obama puts his tax plan in place. I expect to spend more time playing with my kids. They will be poorer when they grow up, but perhaps they will have a few more happy memories.</p></blockquote><p>And here’s <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/12/greg_mankiws_wo.html\">what I wrote at the time</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To start with, it does sound like Mankiw’s kids are already well provided for, and, although I’m sure they’d disagree with me on this, it’s not clear that they would benefit from having more money in the bank when their parents are gone.</p><p>So, from that point of view, the question is why Mankiw isn’t already spending more time playing with his kids?</p><p>I can’t speak for him, but for me, I have to say that it can be fun to work (or even to write blog entries). But, more than that, I feel a sense of obligation to get things done. At some level, getting paid is part of the motivation, but in any particular example I’m not quite sure how it fits in. I do lots of work things that pay me $0; I think they’re important, so I do them.</p></blockquote><p>When I get extra money, one thing I spend it on is students, assistants, and postdocs.  But, for that, the marginal tax rate is nothing close to 90% or even 80%.  For Mankiw, I’m not sure; maybe he makes enough from his textbooks that he doesn’t need much of his academic salary and could possibly do more by converting it into postdocs and research assistants. Or maybe he already has more research assistants than he knows what to do with; I don’t know. But his division of waking hours into “working” or “playing with kids” is, I would guess, not very sensitive to the marginal tax rate.</p><p><strong>Back to taxes</strong></p><p>In writing the above, I’m not trying to suggest that the tax rate be X% or Y% or Z%. I don’t know anything about macroeconomics and have nothing to offer you, the readers, on this topic.</p><p>My real point:  <em>economics is hard</em>.  Greg Mankiw is one of the world’s experts on macroeconomics, but when it comes to a seemingly simple problem in micro—anticipating his personal reactions to taxation—he messes it up, making the classic error of considering only monetary motivations and, bizarrely, suggesting that he’s not out playing with his kids because he’d rather make a thousand bucks writing a newspaper article.  It’s not that I think Mankiw is insincere; I think he just underestimates the difficulty of thinking clearly about decision making.  (I know much much much less than Mankiw about economics, but I’ve done enough research in <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/decision-theory/\">decision analysis</a> to know the challenges that arise in analyzing even the simplest decisions.)</p><p><strong>The irony of hard-headedness</strong></p><p>The irony is that Mankiw (like so many people, particularly economists!) is conditioned to be hard-headed and think that it’s all about the benjamins, when, really, he’s writing newspaper articles for the completely sane reason that he wants to make the world a better place, and he’d like to do this by presenting cogent arguments that can help convince people that his views are correct.  I assume that Mankiw sincerely believes that higher taxes on the rich are a bad thing and will ultimately make everyone less well-off (just as Krugman, say, believes the opposite).  But he feels uncomfortable characterizing his actions as idealistic and, as a result, ends up placing his work and child-care decisions into a nearly nonsensical framework of dollars and cents.</p><p>P.S.

He can accept that he plays with his kids for non-monetary reasons; why is it so difficult to accept that he writes newspaper columns for nonmonetary reasons also? I’m not saying he should not write more columns; I just think it’s a bit silly to analyze that decision based on his dollar compensation for them, given that this has got to be the most minor reason for writing them.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/greg-mankiws-utility-function/\">Greg Mankiw’s utility function</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com\">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a>.</p>" "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/greg-mankiws-utility-function/" (21294 64323) old 35 nil nil ((title nil "Greg Mankiw’s utility function") (link nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/greg-mankiws-utility-function/") (comments nil "http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/23/greg-mankiws-utility-function/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sun, 23 Mar 2014 15:18:27 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Andrew") (category nil "Decision Theory") (category nil "Economics") (guid ((isPermaLink .

A bit over 100 years ago, social scientists such as Galton applied this theorem to all sorts of biological and social phenomena. The central limit theorem, in its generality, is also important in the information that it indirectly conveys when it fails.</p><p>For example, the distribution of the heights of adult men or women is nicely bell-shaped, but the distribution of the heights of all adults has a different, more spread-out distribution. This is because your height is the sum of many small factors and one large factor—your sex. The conditions of the theorem are that no single factor (or small number of factors) should be important on its own. For another example, it has long been observed that incomes do not follow a bell-shaped curve, even on the logarithmic scale. Nor do sizes of cities and many other social phenomena. These “power-law curves,” which don’t fit the central limit theorem, have motivated social scientists such as Herbert Simon to come up with processes more complicated than simple averaging (for example, models in which the rich get richer).</p><p>The central limit theorem is an example of an attractor—a mathematical model that appears as a limit as sample size gets large. The key feature of an attractor is that it destroys information. Think of it as being like a funnel: all sorts of things can come in, but a single thing—the bell-shaped curve—comes out. (Or, for other models, such as that used to describe the distribution of incomes, the attractor might be a power-law distribution.) The beauty of an attractor is that, if you believe the model, it can be used to explain an observed pattern without needing to know the details of its components. Thus, for example, we can see that the heights of men or of women have bell-shaped distributions, without knowing the details of the many small genetic and environmental influences on height.</p><p>Now to random matrices.</p><div></div><p>A random matrix is an array of numbers, where each number is drawn from some specified probability distribution. You can compute the eigenvalues of a square matrix—that’s a set of numbers summarizing the structure of the matrix—and they will have a probability distribution that is induced by the probability distribution of the individual elements of the matrix. Over the past few decades, mathematicians such as Alan Edelman have performed computer simulations and proved theorems deriving the distribution of the eigenvalues of a random matrix, as the dimension of the matrix becomes large.</p><p>It appears that the eigenvalue distribution is an attractor. That is, for a broad range of different input models (distributions of the random matrices), you get the same output—the same eigenvalue distribution—as the sample size becomes large. This is interesting, and it’s hard to prove. (At least, it seemed hard to prove the last time I looked at it, about 20 years ago, and I’m sure that it’s even harder to make advances in the field today!)</p><p>Now, to return to the news article. If the eigenvalue distribution is an attractor, this means that a lot of physical and social phenomena which can be modeled by eigenvalues (including, apparently, quantum energy levels and some properties of statistical tests) might have a common structure. Just as, at a similar level, we see the normal distribution and related functions in all sorts of unusual places.</p><p>Consider this quote from Buchanan’s article:</p><blockquote><p>Recently, for example, physicist Ferdinand Kuemmeth and colleagues at Harvard University used it to predict the energy levels of electrons in the gold nanoparticles they had constructed. Traditional theories suggest that such energy levels should be influenced by a bewildering range of factors, including the precise shape and size of the nanoparticle and the relative position of the atoms, which is considered to be more or less random. Nevertheless, Kuemmeth’s team found that random matrix theory described the measured levels very accurately.</p></blockquote><p>That’s what an attractor is all about: different inputs, same output.</p><p>Thus, I don’t quite understand this quote:</p><blockquote><p>Random matrix theory has got mathematicians like Percy Deift of New York University imagining that there might be more general patterns there too. “This kind of thinking isn’t common in mathematics,” he notes. ‘Mathematicians tend to think that each of their problems has its own special, distinguishing features. But in recent years we have begun to see that problems from diverse areas, often with no discernible connections, all behave in a very similar way.</p></blockquote><p>This doesn’t seem like such a surprise to me—it seems very much in the tradition of mathematical modeling. But maybe there’s something I’m missing here.</p><p>Finally, Buchanan turns to social science:</p><blockquote><p>An economist may sift through hundreds of data sets looking for something to explain changes in inflation – perhaps oil futures, interest rates or industrial inventories. Businesses such as Amazon.com rely on similar techniques to spot patterns in buyer behaviour and help direct their advertising.</p><p>While random matrix theory suggests that this is a promising approach, it also points to hidden dangers. As more and more complex data is collected, the number of variables being studied grows, and the number of apparent correlations between them grows even faster. With enough variables to test, it becomes almost certain that you will detect correlations that look significant, even if they aren’t. . . . even if these variables are all fluctuating randomly, the largest observed correlation will be large enough to seem significant.</p></blockquote><p>This is well known. The new idea is that mathematical theory might enable the distribution of these correlations to be understood for a general range of cases. That’s interesting but doesn’t alter the basic statistical ideas.</p><p>Beyond this, I think there’s a flaw in the idea that statistics (or econometrics) proceeds by blindly looking at the correlations among all variables. In my experience, it makes more sense to fit a hierarchical model, using structure in the economic indexes rather than just throwing them all in as predictors. We are in fact studying the properties of hierarchical models when the number of cases and variables becomes large, and it’s a hard problem. Maybe the ideas from random matrix theory will be relevant here too.</p><p>Buchanan writes:</p><p>In recent years, some economists have begun to express doubts over predictions made from huge volumes of data, but they are in the minority. Most embrace the idea that more measurements mean better predictive abilities. That might be an illusion, and random matrix theory could be the tool to separate what is real and what is not.</p><p>I’m with most economists here: I think that, on average, more measurements do mean better predictive abilities! Maybe not if you are only allowed to look at correlations and least-squares regressions, but if you can model with more structure than, yes, more information should be better.</p></blockquote><p>Update (2014):</p><p>I wonder how things are going in this field.

A bit over 100 years ago, social scientists such as Galton applied this theorem to all sorts of biological and social phenomena. The central limit theorem, in its generality, is also important in the information that it indirectly conveys when it fails.</p><p>For example, the distribution of the heights of adult men or women is nicely bell-shaped, but the distribution of the heights of all adults has a different, more spread-out distribution. This is because your height is the sum of many small factors and one large factor&#8212;your sex. The conditions of the theorem are that no single factor (or small number of factors) should be important on its own. For another example, it has long been observed that incomes do not follow a bell-shaped curve, even on the logarithmic scale. Nor do sizes of cities and many other social phenomena. These “power-law curves,” which don’t fit the central limit theorem, have motivated social scientists such as Herbert Simon to come up with processes more complicated than simple averaging (for example, models in which the rich get richer).</p><p>The central limit theorem is an example of an attractor&#8212;a mathematical model that appears as a limit as sample size gets large. The key feature of an attractor is that it destroys information. Think of it as being like a funnel: all sorts of things can come in, but a single thing&#8212;the bell-shaped curve&#8212;comes out. (Or, for other models, such as that used to describe the distribution of incomes, the attractor might be a power-law distribution.) The beauty of an attractor is that, if you believe the model, it can be used to explain an observed pattern without needing to know the details of its components. Thus, for example, we can see that the heights of men or of women have bell-shaped distributions, without knowing the details of the many small genetic and environmental influences on height.</p><p>Now to random matrices.</p><div></div><p>A random matrix is an array of numbers, where each number is drawn from some specified probability distribution. You can compute the eigenvalues of a square matrix&#8212;that’s a set of numbers summarizing the structure of the matrix&#8212;and they will have a probability distribution that is induced by the probability distribution of the individual elements of the matrix. Over the past few decades, mathematicians such as Alan Edelman have performed computer simulations and proved theorems deriving the distribution of the eigenvalues of a random matrix, as the dimension of the matrix becomes large.</p><p>It appears that the eigenvalue distribution is an attractor. That is, for a broad range of different input models (distributions of the random matrices), you get the same output&#8212;the same eigenvalue distribution&#8212;as the sample size becomes large. This is interesting, and it’s hard to prove. (At least, it seemed hard to prove the last time I looked at it, about 20 years ago, and I’m sure that it’s even harder to make advances in the field today!)</p><p>Now, to return to the news article. If the eigenvalue distribution is an attractor, this means that a lot of physical and social phenomena which can be modeled by eigenvalues (including, apparently, quantum energy levels and some properties of statistical tests) might have a common structure. Just as, at a similar level, we see the normal distribution and related functions in all sorts of unusual places.</p><p>Consider this quote from Buchanan’s article:</p><blockquote><p>Recently, for example, physicist Ferdinand Kuemmeth and colleagues at Harvard University used it to predict the energy levels of electrons in the gold nanoparticles they had constructed. Traditional theories suggest that such energy levels should be influenced by a bewildering range of factors, including the precise shape and size of the nanoparticle and the relative position of the atoms, which is considered to be more or less random. Nevertheless, Kuemmeth’s team found that random matrix theory described the measured levels very accurately.</p></blockquote><p>That’s what an attractor is all about: different inputs, same output.</p><p>Thus, I don’t quite understand this quote:</p><blockquote><p>Random matrix theory has got mathematicians like Percy Deift of New York University imagining that there might be more general patterns there too. “This kind of thinking isn’t common in mathematics,” he notes. ‘Mathematicians tend to think that each of their problems has its own special, distinguishing features. But in recent years we have begun to see that problems from diverse areas, often with no discernible connections, all behave in a very similar way.</p></blockquote><p>This doesn’t seem like such a surprise to me&#8212;it seems very much in the tradition of mathematical modeling. But maybe there’s something I’m missing here.</p><p>Finally, Buchanan turns to social science:</p><blockquote><p>An economist may sift through hundreds of data sets looking for something to explain changes in inflation – perhaps oil futures, interest rates or industrial inventories. Businesses such as Amazon.com rely on similar techniques to spot patterns in buyer behaviour and help direct their advertising.</p><p>While random matrix theory suggests that this is a promising approach, it also points to hidden dangers. As more and more complex data is collected, the number of variables being studied grows, and the number of apparent correlations between them grows even faster. With enough variables to test, it becomes almost certain that you will detect correlations that look significant, even if they aren’t. . . . even if these variables are all fluctuating randomly, the largest observed correlation will be large enough to seem significant.</p></blockquote><p>This is well known. The new idea is that mathematical theory might enable the distribution of these correlations to be understood for a general range of cases. That’s interesting but doesn’t alter the basic statistical ideas.</p><p>Beyond this, I think there’s a flaw in the idea that statistics (or econometrics) proceeds by blindly looking at the correlations among all variables. In my experience, it makes more sense to fit a hierarchical model, using structure in the economic indexes rather than just throwing them all in as predictors. We are in fact studying the properties of hierarchical models when the number of cases and variables becomes large, and it’s a hard problem. Maybe the ideas from random matrix theory will be relevant here too.</p><p>Buchanan writes:</p><p>In recent years, some economists have begun to express doubts over predictions made from huge volumes of data, but they are in the minority. Most embrace the idea that more measurements mean better predictive abilities. That might be an illusion, and random matrix theory could be the tool to separate what is real and what is not.</p><p>I’m with most economists here: I think that, on average, more measurements do mean better predictive abilities! Maybe not if you are only allowed to look at correlations and least-squares regressions, but if you can model with more structure than, yes, more information should be better.</p></blockquote><p>Update (2014):</p><p>I wonder how things are going in this field.

As they say in poker, I went all in on it, I wanted to make it the best possible thing.</p><p>I notice from your blog as well that <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/06/stop-me-before-i-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/\">one of the stereotypes</a> that you are keen on debunking is this idea that working-class people in America vote conservative. A number of people have <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340019063&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=what%27s+the+matter+with+kansas\">gone to some lengths</a> to try to explain this phenomenon, but you seem to think it’s a bit of a red herring.</p><p>Somehow people on the left and on the right find it difficult to understand. On the left, people think that 100% of working-class people should vote for the left, so anything less than 100% makes them feel that there is something that went wrong. They just cannot understand how this could be. On the right, you get the opposite. It’s considered a validation – they want to believe that these more virtuous people are voting for them. But even in the days of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, a lot of low-income people voted Republican. There was no magic golden age in which lower-income working-class people were uniformly Democrat. It was always various subgroups of the population.</p><p>How many of the poor did vote for the Democrats, say, in the last election?</p><p>Of the lowest third of the population about 60% voted for the Democrats.</p><p>What if you narrow it down to blue-collar workers though? Don’t the majority of them vote conservative?</p><p>Then you have to ask, what does that exactly mean? Someone could make $100,000 a year and be blue collar. Conversely, if you’re a woman cleaning bedpans and making very little money, you’re not blue collar. Cleaning bedpans is not considered blue-collar work. There is the way that, firstly, blue collar conveys some sort of moral superiority, and secondly that it just happens to exclude a lot of the female workforce, who are more likely to be Democrats. If you take only blue collar – which is mostly male – and don’t even restrict for income and then you go beyond that to only include whites, you’re chipping away at various groups that support the Democrats, without noticing what’s happening. It sounds very innocuous to talk about blue-collar whites, but you’re selecting a subgroup among this social class which is particularly conservative, and then making some claims about them.</p><p>What’s the single most interesting thing you discovered writing your book?</p></blockquote><p><span id=\"more-22854\"></span></p><blockquote><p>If I had to summarise one thing from <em>Red State, Blue State</em> that we discovered, it’s the fact that the biggest differences between red states and blue states are occurring at the upper-income level, rather than the lower-income level. If you look at high-income voters, America is very geographically and ideologically divided. If you look at lower-income voters, there’s less division. That was really our big point.</p><p>Explain a bit more.</p><p>If you compare states like New York and California on the one hand and Texas on the other, the lower-income voters in these states don’t differ so much. Obama did better among lower-income voters in New York than in Texas, but it wasn’t as different as the differences among high-income voters. Another way of saying this is that if you compare people’s attitudes from surveys in Republican-leaning states to Democrat-leaning states, low-income people don’t differ much, on average, in their social and economic attitudes. Low-income Americans tend to be economically liberal and fairly moderate on social issues. Upper-middle-class Americans, on other hand, vary a lot by region. In Republican states they tend to be very conservative on economic issues and moderate on social issues. In Democrat-leaning states, upper-middle-class or rich people tend to be moderately conservative on economics and liberal on social issues.</p><p>If you look at the very richest Americans – we don’t know about them from surveys, but we can look at campaign contributions – they’re very important campaign contributors for the Republicans. The rich supporters of the Republicans are very conservative economically. The very richest Americans are also very important contributors for the Democrats. But the rich supporters of the Democrats are not ultra-left economically. The richest people on the left don’t like the Republicans, they’ll support moderately higher taxes and so forth, but they’re not socialists. They’re not so extreme. So there’s an asymmetry there.</p><p>As a statistician, if you were giving Obama election advice now, what would you tell him to do?</p><p>He needs to do what’s possible to make people feel more prosperous. He knows that. Both sides have a lot of experts so they understand that. I don’t know if I have any special advice. They’re going to put most of their effort on swing states, which makes sense, but I don’t think they’re going to learn much from polling these states and finding out little fluctuations. Public opinion swings tend to be national swings.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><blockquote><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50301\"><div><img title=\"The Almanac of American Politics 2012\" alt=\"Image of The Almanac of American Politics 2012\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514TLXKQ6oL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"107\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Almanac of American Politics\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">The Almanac of American Politics</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Almanac of American Politics\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">By Michael Barone and Chuck McCutcheon</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Let’s talk about this some more in the context of the books you’ve chosen. You’ve started with <em>The Almanac of American Politics, </em>which is published every two years by <em><a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/\">The National Journal</a></em>.</p><p>This first came out in 1971 and it was written for many years by a journalist named Michael Barone. It was really an amazing book, especially when it first came out. It had 435 chapters, a little essay about each congressional district in the country, who lived there and what it was like. It’s a book that’s been very important to political professionals, but it’s almost like a bit of sociology. If you read a book about contemporary America it will focus on whatever it focuses on, whatever the interests of the author are. Even a book that’s more encyclopaedic, might talk about the 50 states. But the 50 states are different sizes, and some are much bigger than others. By being forced to write a little essay about each congressional district, this book created a geographically balanced portrait of America, which you just could not get anywhere else. And it was just fun to read.</p><p>Now – you could always tell this but over the years it became more and more of a clear pattern – there is a bit of an ideological bias in the book. Barone is now an outspoken conservative – in fact he embarrassed himself a few years ago by saying that the liberal media had attacked Sarah Palin because she did not abort her Down syndrome baby. Then he apologised and said it was a joke. Going back to <em>The Almanac of American Politics</em>, you realise he has a little bit of a thumb on the scale. If he’s talking about a place where people vote for Democrats, it always seems to be a declining, rust-belt, corrupt area, and when it’s an area that’s voting for Republicans, it’s always a dynamic, exciting part of the country. But it’s still amazing. Go back and read some of the early ones especially, and then skip a decade and read it again, and you get a portrait of America that, even if it’s not perfect, is unique.</p><p>Did you use it for your research?</p><p>In 1990 when I got my PhD I went to Berkeley into the statistics department. They offered me a few thousand dollars so I could buy a home computer. I said I didn’t want one – I would take the money and buy books instead. This was one of the books on the list. This was the book that, in the old days, every American political scientist would have on their shelf. There’s no substitute. Even Wikipedia is not really a substitute. If you want to look up any particular district, you can look it up, but having a book where every district takes up the same amount of space, there’s just something amazing about it.</p><p>Give an example of something I might want to look up.</p><p>You might want to look up something you’re personally interested in, like where you live or where you went to college, or where your mother grew up. Or you might open up to anywhere. What’s the 19th district in Illinois like? And it would be this thumbnail portrait of this area of 700,000 Americans, and what makes them vote one way or the other. Of course it has numbers too. It’s a bit like one of these baseball statistics books. You have the description of the player and then his statistics. You can see how the Republicans and Democrats have done in elections in these districts.</p><p>OK, I’ll look up the part of New York state I live in, because I’ve always wondered about the political attitudes of the people around me. It seems to be impolite in America to talk about politics or ask any direct questions, so this may be a way around that.</p><p>It is public information if people are registered for a party. If you’re a registered Democrat I should be able to find that out just by going and looking at the public records. I was just reading an autobiography of Ring Lardner Jr. He’s famous for writing the screenplay for M*A*S*H, and he was part of a Hollywood blacklist for many years. He had a story about how the FBI had been following him for decades because they knew how he voted. We’re supposed to have a secret ballot, but in his precinct in Los Angeles he was the only person listed who was neither Democrat nor Republican. When they posted the election results after election day, there were a certain number of people who voted for Franklin Roosevelt, the Democrat, and a certain number of people who voted for Alf Landon the Republican, and then there was one vote for the Communist.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50302\"><div><img title=\"The 480\" alt=\"Image of The 480\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qmkg9R5SL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The 480\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">The 480</a></h2><p><a title=\"The 480\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">By Eugene Burdick</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Let’s go on to your next book, <em>The 480,</em> by Eugene Burdick.</p><p>This is a novel that was written in 1964, by one of the authors of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Ugly-American-Eugene-Burdick/dp/0393318672?Tag=thebro-21\"><em>The</em> <em>Ugly</em> <em>American</em></a>, which is a book you might not have ever heard of but you’ve heard the phrase. It was a cultural touchstone. It came out in the late 1950s, and it took place in a hypothetical, Vietnam-like country in Asia, and it’s about the Americans losing the war of hearts and minds to the Communists.</p><p><em>The 480</em> is about evil political consultants who are manipulating the American public to vote for an empty-suit type of character for president. The number 480 referred to an actual analysis that was done by some political scientists, including a political scientist named Sam Popkin, who is now at the University of California in San Diego. They divided the population into 480 demographic and geographic subgroups, based on things like religion, age, sex, what region of the country and so on. The idea was that they knew how many people were in each group and they would pitch their messages to those groups. It’s a classic work in political science. I think they also advised the Kennedy campaign. Back then it was very impressive, but we can do much more now in terms of data analysis, we can get estimates for all 50 states now which they couldn’t do back then.</p><p>But there was something funny about this book, about these backroom political consultants manipulating the election. It’s not at all realistic, though it’s much more realistic than a book like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manchurian-Candidate-Richard-Condon/dp/1568582706/?Tag=thebro-21\"><em>The</em> <em>Manchurian</em> <em>Candidate</em></a>, which is a big joke. This book is a satire but it reflects serious concerns about politics.</p><p>Presumably, then, the implication is that there is something sinister about having all this information?</p><p>The idea is that these people know enough about us so that they can manipulate our vote. Realistically, political consultants nowadays know a lot about us, and they do try to convince us. There are two kinds of people they follow. One is people where they know who they’re going to vote for, but they’re not sure that they’re going to vote. The other is people who are very likely to vote, but you don’t know which way they’re going to vote. The first type of person they try to mobilise just to turn out and vote, and the second kind of person they try to persuade. They’re pretty good at knowing who people are. In fact, at this point, a lot of this is just a question of resources. To the extent they have resources they will go out to people and call you on the phone. If they think you’re already likely to vote for a certain candidate, they’ll try to find somebody to knock on your door and convince you that it’s an important election and it’s worth voting for. In some sense it’s not as mysterious or conspiratorial as it’s made out to be in that book.</p><p>It’s just a question of resources?</p><p>Yes, it’s expensive. It’s said to cost about $40 per vote. You have to get enthusiastic volunteers and really knock on people’s doors.</p><p>It’s not about sending out some subliminal message – it’s just about having someone enthusiastic on your doorstep?</p><p>They do play with the messages a lot. They do a lot of experimentation. I remember reading one paper that came out where they framed the same question in two different ways. They try to say things like, “Everybody votes, so you should vote too.” I don’t know how much I believe it, but from some experimental evidence they claim that certain phrasing is particularly effective. Of course both sides are doing it, which is what you’d want. It’s only fair for both sides to do it. A lot of the great inequalities arise before you get to the general election. Certain candidates just don’t have a chance in the primary because they don’t have the money. The two parties are more equally balanced. The other issues in unfairness come in what policies the parties consider. The actual election is not too far from a fair fight.</p><p>What do you mean by unfairness in the policies parties consider?</p><p>I mean that there are policies that get proposed and policies that don’t get proposed, and the lobbyists have an impact. When the election year comes up, we think a lot about elections. But if you think about what issues get raised in Congress and what things the president does and doesn’t do, a lot of those are going to be affected by campaign contributors.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50303\"><div><img title=\"The Rational Public: Fifty Years of Trends in Americans&amp;#039; Policy Preferences (American Politics and Political Economy Series)\" alt=\"Image of The Rational Public: Fifty Years of Trends in Americans&amp;#039; Policy Preferences (American Politics and Political Economy Series)\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EbVJkmWRL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"105\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Rational Public\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">The Rational Public</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Rational Public\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">By Benjamin I Page and Robert Y Shapiro</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Tell me about <em>The Rational Public: 50 Years of Trends in Americans’ Policy Preferences.</em></p><p><em>The Rational Public</em> was written by two political scientists, Ben Page and Bob Shapiro. Bob Shapiro has the office next to mine in the political science department here at Columbia. The book came out in 1992 and they found something in public opinion that my colleagues and I had already noticed in elections, which is something we call “uniform partisan swing”. I don’t know how it is in other countries, but the basic idea is that Americans are spread out on some left-right scale, and we are, of course, quite diverse in our opinions. But when there is a change in opinion it tends to move everybody together. Not always, but generally. For example, gay rights are more popular than they used to be, amongst pretty much all groups. Or attitudes about economic issues – Americans are more economically conservative and more socially liberal than they used to be. Things tend to move at a national level.</p><p>Normally, when you have an election, it’s the same. Barack Obama is expected to get 4% to 5% less of the vote this election than last time. It’s roughly the same amount less in every state. Page and Shapiro looked at a whole bunch of issues and found that people were moving together.</p><p>They also found that people’s attitudes were rational, they made some sense. There have been findings in public opinion literature about something called “non-attitudes”, which is that sometimes you ask people a question and you come back and ask them later and they seem to have a completely different answer. But on issues that people have thought about, people have fairly sensible views. Often people have reasonable views that are not always conveyed that well, because they contradict a larger story. For example, voters tend to be consistently willing to cut certain aspects of the budget, including the military. But cutting the military is never very popular in Congress. That’s something you don’t always hear about. Americans support the military but they don’t support such a high military budget. It’s a very impressive book. They go through every issue and it’s quantitative – they have a lot of graphs – but they look at every issue seriously on its own terms.</p><p>So the public really is rational?</p><p>That’s what they say. The public can be manipulated, but generally they feel that people have fairly consistent views.</p><p>Why does this happen, people swinging on issues together, at a national level?</p><p>The ideological playing field is already laid out, so it varies. Sometimes an issue will become politicised. Take, for example, attitudes about climate change. That became very politicised – Democrats and Republicans moved in different directions. Most issues are already politicised. Once the politicisation has happened, once the issue has gone through that phase, then everybody tends to move together. You can even think about it in terms of attitudes to Obama. When he was elected, Democrats were very excited about him, and Republicans were sceptical. Independents wanted to give him a chance. Then, after some bad economic years, we have Republicans really detesting him, Independents not liking him – and Democrats not really liking him much either. The interesting thing is that a lot of Democrats say they don’t like Obama because they feel he’s not so liberal, he’s selling out, whereas a lot of Republicans don’t like Obama because they feel he’s an ideologue. I don’t buy either of those claims. What I think is happening is that fundamentally people aren’t liking Obama because they don’t think he’s performing well. They just have different storylines. The Republican storyline for someone who is a Democrat who they don’t like is that he’s an extreme liberal. The Democratic storyline for someone they don’t like is that he’s a weak sell-out. Even though it seems like they’re having opposite reactions, in reality it’s just the same reaction that’s being rationalised. It’s not that people are being irrational, it’s that the reason they give for their attitudes doesn’t always hold up. But the actual attitude is reasonable. Even if people get a lot of the facts wrong – and you can certainly do survey after survey, where you see people getting the facts wrong, and misunderstanding things – it is reasonable to say you’re less supportive of the president after some bad economic times.</p><p>Going back to what we discussed at the beginning, and this trend discussed in books like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X\"><em>What’s</em> <em>the</em> <em>Matter</em> <em>with</em> <em>Kansas</em>?</a> – you really don’t think it’s irrational to vote against your economic interests?</p><p>What’s <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/published/rational_final6.pdf\">rational in voting</a> is not about your own personal economic interests. The main outcome of the election is not what affects you, it’s what affects the entire country. So there’s a lot of evidence that people vote for what they think is good for the country. Of course, if you’re personally unemployed and know a lot of unemployed people, then it makes sense that you will feel that unemployment is a big issue. On the other hand, if you have money in the bank, people are still somehow concerned about inflation. What you consider important problems are certainly impacted by your experiences. But, no, I don’t think it’s a matter of your direct economic interests. I would say it’s indirect.</p><p>By the way, Bob Shapiro wrote an interesting paper in 2009 right after the last election where he <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2009/07/support_for_hea/\">talked about</a> all the problems Obama would have passing healthcare reform. He was right. Everybody thought it would be easy, but he recognised from looking at the survey data, that things in 2009 with Obama were very similar to what they were in 1993 with Bill Clinton. He’s a very clear-eyed observer. He should be the guy on the TV they ask about public opinion, not all these other bozos.</p><p>So here is one of the broader questions I wanted to put to you: Why is America so right wing? Take healthcare, which you just mentioned. Every other developed country in the world has universal healthcare. For wealthy countries, the idea that the government should either provide it or make sure it’s provided is completely uncontroversial. Why is the US different?</p><p>It’s hard to get from point A to point B. It would probably be hard to find many people who would argue that the American healthcare system is better than the French healthcare system, or even the Taiwanese healthcare system. What’s not obvious is how to get there. There are so many interests involved, so much money, so many companies. If they could somehow switch out the US system and switch in this other system – like they have in Taiwan or France – I think that would be wonderful. But it doesn’t seem that that’s considered an option. There are too many people who are doing fine from the current system. The argument made by the opponents of healthcare reform is that it would just be worse if you tried to get to that point from what we already have – we’d have the worst of both worlds. I don’t know if that’s true, but that’s my answer.</p><p>What about the right-wingness of America generally? When you go to America as a European, you begin to feel like Fidel Castro compared with the people around you. Everyone just seems further to the right on all sorts of issues. Do you have any insights into why that is?</p><p>I don’t have a good answer to that. People sometimes say it has to do with geographical divisions. In the United States the lower-income parts of the country tend to be more politically conservative. This happens in other countries too. The idea is that the richer places within a country – or even within a continent like Europe – tend to be more cosmopolitan, more socially liberal and lower-income places tend to be more traditional. Look at a country like Finland – it used to be one of the poorest places in Europe and now it’s one of the richest places. Being richer is associated with more of an open, liberal social attitude. Economics is more complicated. Traditionally, lower-income areas support more economic redistribution. In Europe, for example, the Greeks are lower income and more supportive of redistribution, and the Germans are in the opposite position.</p><p>In the US that was traditionally the case as well. But now the lower-income areas are less supportive of redistribution. This is one of the issues we explore in our book. We don’t have a complete story. Part of it is to do with racial politics. The South changed to the Republican Party, and there were changes that happened in the South – legal changes in the 1960s, where there was redistricting – and rural parts of the South got less representation and the cities and the suburbs got more representation. People from the cities and the suburbs tend to be more conservative on economic issues, and may be a better fit for the national Republican Party.</p><p>Another thing is that the Democratic Party is very reliant on various groups of rich people. Even to the extent that they’re liberal rich people, they’re not extremely liberal economically. They’re very much supportive of free markets. A Silicon Valley millionaire who supports Obama is looking for a Bill Clinton-style economic boom – he’s not looking for some sort of traditional socialist party.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50304\"><div><img title=\"Fire on the Prairie: Chicago&amp;#039;s Harold Washington and the Politics of Race\" alt=\"Image of Fire on the Prairie: Chicago&amp;#039;s Harold Washington and the Politics of Race\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61USIXmkOTL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"106\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"Fire on the Prairie\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">Fire on the Prairie</a></h2><p><a title=\"Fire on the Prairie\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">By Gary Rivlin</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>You mentioned the politics of race. This is a big part of your next book, <em>Fire on the Prairie</em>, about Chicago’s first black mayor. Do you want to tell me a bit about it?</p><p>This is just an amazing story. It’s written by a journalist from Chicago who was clearly very sympathetic to Harold Washington, who was mayor of Chicago in the 1980s. He was an African-American, he’d been a member of Congress, and after the end of the old Daley machine in Chicago he ran for mayor. Actually there are several amazing stories. First that Chicago is a majority white city and he won the Democratic primary election and then the general election. He took advantage of divisions among his opponents. It was a very racist campaign. Washington was saying his opponents were corrupt and that they needed new leadership; his white opponents were saying that he couldn’t be trusted, that he was corrupt and that you should stick with what you have.</p><p>Then, after he became the mayor, there was just this amazing battle. The city council had 50 members and they were divided between supporters of Washington and supporters of his white opponents with a couple inbetween. Over the next couple of years, through a series of deals and elections, Washington and his allies ended up taking control of the council. It wasn’t just about winning the election, but this Stalingrad-type block-by-block battle afterwards. It’s just a very exciting story. And he won. You just don’t expect to see that. They managed to replace this alderman, then they managed to get this person to vote on their side, and eventually they twisted enough arms and did what they needed. Then Washington died of a heart attack.</p><p>It’s a fascinating book because it’s not only about the election but also about the political manoeuvrings. I’m an expert on public opinion and elections but I don’t really have much understanding of political manoeuvrings. In university politics I always managed to piss people off. This is a readable book, very fascinating, and then at the end when he dies, it’s very sad.</p><p>From the reviews I’ve read, it does seem like a bit of a potboiler.</p><p>It’s got good guys and bad guys, and unexpected twists. Washington was a very tough guy. It would have been very tempting for him to just have given up, and say, “Well, I did what I could.” But he didn’t.</p><p>In terms of the politics of race, what do we need to know about how race affects voting in the US?</p><p>At the national level, close to 90% of African-Americans vote for Democrats. For Obama it was about 96%. I think a lot of white people feel Democrats are the black party and don’t support them for that reason.</p><p>This is particularly in the Southern states?</p><p>Yes, though obviously it was also a big deal in Chicago. The assumption has always been that a black candidate could not win most of the white vote, so at first he was just not considered a serious candidate. It was just assumed that white people weren’t going to vote for this guy.</p><p>Were you incredibly surprised when Obama was elected?</p><p>No. He was in the lead, and the economy had not being doing well, so that meant the Democrat would do well. The stronger the partisan cues are, the less important other things are. People do argue about this. Some people claim – which may be true – that Obama maybe didn’t do as well as he would have done if he’d been white. He did about as well as predicted, based on the economy, but he outspent McCain. You could argue that Obama should have done a couple of percentage points better than forecast, because of the unequal campaign. It’s hard to say. People did some surveys where they claimed that some percentage of white people were less likely to vote for Obama because he was black. This kind of thing came up with Romney too. There were some people who said they wouldn’t vote for him because he’s a Mormon. People say all sorts of things in the abstract, but then when it comes to the election, they vote for him. I don’t really believe a lot of these things now, when people say “I won’t do x or y”. They won’t do it right up to the second they do it, and after they do it, they try to explain why it didn’t count.</p><p>These uniform partisan swings you mentioned, don’t they go against the whole notion of increasing partisanship in the US?</p><p>There is increasing partisanship, but it’s something that is happening gradually. Things that are happening in the timescale of a week or a month or a year, are pretty uniform. Long-term, though, the parties have been moving apart. Democrats are more and more distrustful of the Republicans and Republicans are more and more distrustful of the Democrats. So that is happening at the same time. You have the local uniform swings, within the context of the entire topography changing.</p></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><div><blockquote><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50305\"><div><img title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" alt=\"Image of The Emerging Republican Majority\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JYlXJQrLL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"106\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">The Emerging Republican Majority</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">By Kevin P Phillips</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><div><div><blockquote><p>We’ve got to your last book, <em>The Emerging Republican Majority</em>.</p><p>This is by Kevin Phillips. I don’t know his exact job title, but he worked for Richard Nixon. This was a classic book from 1969, about how American politics were changing. The idea was that, partly as a result of the Democrats becoming more uniformly liberal and having more support of blacks, Republicans would soon be able to get the support of various groups of white people, such as urban Catholics, who had traditionally been very strong Democrats. Richard Nixon could get political success, basically, by convincing a lot of white people – not the white people who are traditionally in charge of the country but so-called ethnic white people – that the Democrats were not on their side. Their pitch was that the Republicans were the only truly national party and the Democrats were a sectional party. The Democrats were representing interest groups and only Republicans were representing America. This was seemingly a very successful pitch, and it really mapped a new populism. It wasn’t a new argument. Nixon was making this argument back when he was Joe McCarthy’s buddy in the 1950s. Back then he was already arguing that the Democrats were a bunch of Communists and elitists, but the message didn’t catch on so well in the 1950s. Somehow it became more convincing around 1970 when the economy wasn’t going so well, and when there was a war in Vietnam and fighting in the streets.</p><p>In the last few years Phillips has written some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/American-Theocracy-Politics-Religion-Borrowed/dp/0143038281/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340073762&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=american+theocracy?tag=thebro-21\">very angry books</a>. He really detests George W Bush, basically arguing that the Republicans have been captured by a mixture of rich elites and extreme religious groups. If you look at a book like <em>The Emerging Republican Majority</em>, it’s not about the rich, it’s much more the idea that the Republicans are the sane middle of the country. He became a bit disturbed. This doesn’t discredit the Republicans, the fact that one of their operatives think they went too far. He’s just one guy. But it’s a very important book historically. It’s about a tactic that was actually followed successfully.</p><p>Does it have insights for the present?</p><p>It has insights in terms of how we got to where we are. Looking back, there was no reason to think the Republicans would become this alliance between some very religiously conservative people and these very economically conservative people. It was a different era of what was possible. Various industrialists at the time would have loved to have very low tax rates, but I don’t think it would have been considered possible. There have been big changes in American politics – big moves to the right on economic issues and to the left on social issues.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div><p>Update (2014):</p><p>I still wish I’d picked a title like Voting by the Numbers or The Secret Life of the American Voter.  “Red State Blue State” is catchy but I think it unfortunately gave people the impression that our book was a popularization of existing research rather than a treasure trove of original research itself.</p><p>Meanwhile, the patterns of income and voting within and between states have changed in some ways since the above discussion.

In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.</p><p>I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would have felt they needed to know all the important secrets in it. Instead, I gave it this accessible title which meant that people felt that they didn’t necessarily have to read it. I also regret not putting more about the process of discovery in that book, how we found out what we found out.</p><p>What would you have called the book if you were given another chance?</p><p>Maybe something like <em>Voting by the Numbers</em> or <em>The Hidden Patterns</em> or <em>Secret Life of the American Voter</em>, something like that. Or something very dry, that conveyed it was serious, like <em>Demography, Geography and American Voting</em>. Almost every time there was a graph, it involved a separate little research project. I put in huge amounts of effort. As they say in poker, I went all in on it, I wanted to make it the best possible thing.</p><p>I notice from your blog as well that <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/06/stop-me-before-i-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/\">one of the stereotypes</a> that you are keen on debunking is this idea that working-class people in America vote conservative. A number of people have <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340019063&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=what%27s+the+matter+with+kansas\">gone to some lengths</a> to try to explain this phenomenon, but you seem to think it’s a bit of a red herring.</p><p>Somehow people on the left and on the right find it difficult to understand. On the left, people think that 100% of working-class people should vote for the left, so anything less than 100% makes them feel that there is something that went wrong. They just cannot understand how this could be. On the right, you get the opposite. It’s considered a validation – they want to believe that these more virtuous people are voting for them. But even in the days of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, a lot of low-income people voted Republican. There was no magic golden age in which lower-income working-class people were uniformly Democrat. It was always various subgroups of the population.</p><p>How many of the poor did vote for the Democrats, say, in the last election?</p><p>Of the lowest third of the population about 60% voted for the Democrats.</p><p>What if you narrow it down to blue-collar workers though? Don’t the majority of them vote conservative?</p><p>Then you have to ask, what does that exactly mean? Someone could make $100,000 a year and be blue collar. Conversely, if you’re a woman cleaning bedpans and making very little money, you’re not blue collar. Cleaning bedpans is not considered blue-collar work. There is the way that, firstly, blue collar conveys some sort of moral superiority, and secondly that it just happens to exclude a lot of the female workforce, who are more likely to be Democrats. If you take only blue collar – which is mostly male – and don’t even restrict for income and then you go beyond that to only include whites, you’re chipping away at various groups that support the Democrats, without noticing what’s happening. It sounds very innocuous to talk about blue-collar whites, but you’re selecting a subgroup among this social class which is particularly conservative, and then making some claims about them.</p><p>What’s the single most interesting thing you discovered writing your book?</p></blockquote><p><span id=\"more-22854\"></span></p><blockquote><p>If I had to summarise one thing from <em>Red State, Blue State</em> that we discovered, it’s the fact that the biggest differences between red states and blue states are occurring at the upper-income level, rather than the lower-income level. If you look at high-income voters, America is very geographically and ideologically divided. If you look at lower-income voters, there’s less division. That was really our big point.</p><p>Explain a bit more.</p><p>If you compare states like New York and California on the one hand and Texas on the other, the lower-income voters in these states don’t differ so much. Obama did better among lower-income voters in New York than in Texas, but it wasn’t as different as the differences among high-income voters. Another way of saying this is that if you compare people’s attitudes from surveys in Republican-leaning states to Democrat-leaning states, low-income people don’t differ much, on average, in their social and economic attitudes. Low-income Americans tend to be economically liberal and fairly moderate on social issues. Upper-middle-class Americans, on other hand, vary a lot by region. In Republican states they tend to be very conservative on economic issues and moderate on social issues. In Democrat-leaning states, upper-middle-class or rich people tend to be moderately conservative on economics and liberal on social issues.</p><p>If you look at the very richest Americans – we don’t know about them from surveys, but we can look at campaign contributions – they’re very important campaign contributors for the Republicans. The rich supporters of the Republicans are very conservative economically. The very richest Americans are also very important contributors for the Democrats. But the rich supporters of the Democrats are not ultra-left economically. The richest people on the left don’t like the Republicans, they’ll support moderately higher taxes and so forth, but they’re not socialists. They’re not so extreme. So there’s an asymmetry there.</p><p>As a statistician, if you were giving Obama election advice now, what would you tell him to do?</p><p>He needs to do what’s possible to make people feel more prosperous. He knows that. Both sides have a lot of experts so they understand that. I don’t know if I have any special advice. They’re going to put most of their effort on swing states, which makes sense, but I don’t think they’re going to learn much from polling these states and finding out little fluctuations. Public opinion swings tend to be national swings.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><blockquote><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50301\"><div><img title=\"The Almanac of American Politics 2012\" alt=\"Image of The Almanac of American Politics 2012\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514TLXKQ6oL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"107\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Almanac of American Politics\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">The Almanac of American Politics</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Almanac of American Politics\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">By Michael Barone and Chuck McCutcheon</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/almanac-american-politics-by-michael-barone-and-chuck-mccutcheon\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Let’s talk about this some more in the context of the books you’ve chosen. You’ve started with <em>The Almanac of American Politics, </em>which is published every two years by <em><a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/\">The National Journal</a></em>.</p><p>This first came out in 1971 and it was written for many years by a journalist named Michael Barone. It was really an amazing book, especially when it first came out. It had 435 chapters, a little essay about each congressional district in the country, who lived there and what it was like. It’s a book that’s been very important to political professionals, but it’s almost like a bit of sociology. If you read a book about contemporary America it will focus on whatever it focuses on, whatever the interests of the author are. Even a book that’s more encyclopaedic, might talk about the 50 states. But the 50 states are different sizes, and some are much bigger than others. By being forced to write a little essay about each congressional district, this book created a geographically balanced portrait of America, which you just could not get anywhere else. And it was just fun to read.</p><p>Now – you could always tell this but over the years it became more and more of a clear pattern – there is a bit of an ideological bias in the book. Barone is now an outspoken conservative – in fact he embarrassed himself a few years ago by saying that the liberal media had attacked Sarah Palin because she did not abort her Down syndrome baby. Then he apologised and said it was a joke. Going back to <em>The Almanac of American Politics</em>, you realise he has a little bit of a thumb on the scale. If he’s talking about a place where people vote for Democrats, it always seems to be a declining, rust-belt, corrupt area, and when it’s an area that’s voting for Republicans, it’s always a dynamic, exciting part of the country. But it’s still amazing. Go back and read some of the early ones especially, and then skip a decade and read it again, and you get a portrait of America that, even if it’s not perfect, is unique.</p><p>Did you use it for your research?</p><p>In 1990 when I got my PhD I went to Berkeley into the statistics department. They offered me a few thousand dollars so I could buy a home computer. I said I didn’t want one – I would take the money and buy books instead. This was one of the books on the list. This was the book that, in the old days, every American political scientist would have on their shelf. There’s no substitute. Even Wikipedia is not really a substitute. If you want to look up any particular district, you can look it up, but having a book where every district takes up the same amount of space, there’s just something amazing about it.</p><p>Give an example of something I might want to look up.</p><p>You might want to look up something you’re personally interested in, like where you live or where you went to college, or where your mother grew up. Or you might open up to anywhere. What’s the 19th district in Illinois like? And it would be this thumbnail portrait of this area of 700,000 Americans, and what makes them vote one way or the other. Of course it has numbers too. It’s a bit like one of these baseball statistics books. You have the description of the player and then his statistics. You can see how the Republicans and Democrats have done in elections in these districts.</p><p>OK, I’ll look up the part of New York state I live in, because I’ve always wondered about the political attitudes of the people around me. It seems to be impolite in America to talk about politics or ask any direct questions, so this may be a way around that.</p><p>It is public information if people are registered for a party. If you’re a registered Democrat I should be able to find that out just by going and looking at the public records. I was just reading an autobiography of Ring Lardner Jr. He’s famous for writing the screenplay for M*A*S*H, and he was part of a Hollywood blacklist for many years. He had a story about how the FBI had been following him for decades because they knew how he voted. We’re supposed to have a secret ballot, but in his precinct in Los Angeles he was the only person listed who was neither Democrat nor Republican. When they posted the election results after election day, there were a certain number of people who voted for Franklin Roosevelt, the Democrat, and a certain number of people who voted for Alf Landon the Republican, and then there was one vote for the Communist.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50302\"><div><img title=\"The 480\" alt=\"Image of The 480\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qmkg9R5SL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The 480\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">The 480</a></h2><p><a title=\"The 480\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">By Eugene Burdick</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/480-by-eugene-burdick\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Let’s go on to your next book, <em>The 480,</em> by Eugene Burdick.</p><p>This is a novel that was written in 1964, by one of the authors of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Ugly-American-Eugene-Burdick/dp/0393318672?Tag=thebro-21\"><em>The</em> <em>Ugly</em> <em>American</em></a>, which is a book you might not have ever heard of but you’ve heard the phrase. It was a cultural touchstone. It came out in the late 1950s, and it took place in a hypothetical, Vietnam-like country in Asia, and it’s about the Americans losing the war of hearts and minds to the Communists.</p><p><em>The 480</em> is about evil political consultants who are manipulating the American public to vote for an empty-suit type of character for president. The number 480 referred to an actual analysis that was done by some political scientists, including a political scientist named Sam Popkin, who is now at the University of California in San Diego. They divided the population into 480 demographic and geographic subgroups, based on things like religion, age, sex, what region of the country and so on. The idea was that they knew how many people were in each group and they would pitch their messages to those groups. It’s a classic work in political science. I think they also advised the Kennedy campaign. Back then it was very impressive, but we can do much more now in terms of data analysis, we can get estimates for all 50 states now which they couldn’t do back then.</p><p>But there was something funny about this book, about these backroom political consultants manipulating the election. It’s not at all realistic, though it’s much more realistic than a book like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manchurian-Candidate-Richard-Condon/dp/1568582706/?Tag=thebro-21\"><em>The</em> <em>Manchurian</em> <em>Candidate</em></a>, which is a big joke. This book is a satire but it reflects serious concerns about politics.</p><p>Presumably, then, the implication is that there is something sinister about having all this information?</p><p>The idea is that these people know enough about us so that they can manipulate our vote. Realistically, political consultants nowadays know a lot about us, and they do try to convince us. There are two kinds of people they follow. One is people where they know who they’re going to vote for, but they’re not sure that they’re going to vote. The other is people who are very likely to vote, but you don’t know which way they’re going to vote. The first type of person they try to mobilise just to turn out and vote, and the second kind of person they try to persuade. They’re pretty good at knowing who people are. In fact, at this point, a lot of this is just a question of resources. To the extent they have resources they will go out to people and call you on the phone. If they think you’re already likely to vote for a certain candidate, they’ll try to find somebody to knock on your door and convince you that it’s an important election and it’s worth voting for. In some sense it’s not as mysterious or conspiratorial as it’s made out to be in that book.</p><p>It’s just a question of resources?</p><p>Yes, it’s expensive. It’s said to cost about $40 per vote. You have to get enthusiastic volunteers and really knock on people’s doors.</p><p>It’s not about sending out some subliminal message – it’s just about having someone enthusiastic on your doorstep?</p><p>They do play with the messages a lot. They do a lot of experimentation. I remember reading one paper that came out where they framed the same question in two different ways. They try to say things like, “Everybody votes, so you should vote too.” I don’t know how much I believe it, but from some experimental evidence they claim that certain phrasing is particularly effective. Of course both sides are doing it, which is what you’d want. It’s only fair for both sides to do it. A lot of the great inequalities arise before you get to the general election. Certain candidates just don’t have a chance in the primary because they don’t have the money. The two parties are more equally balanced. The other issues in unfairness come in what policies the parties consider. The actual election is not too far from a fair fight.</p><p>What do you mean by unfairness in the policies parties consider?</p><p>I mean that there are policies that get proposed and policies that don’t get proposed, and the lobbyists have an impact. When the election year comes up, we think a lot about elections. But if you think about what issues get raised in Congress and what things the president does and doesn’t do, a lot of those are going to be affected by campaign contributors.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50303\"><div><img title=\"The Rational Public: Fifty Years of Trends in Americans&amp;#039; Policy Preferences (American Politics and Political Economy Series)\" alt=\"Image of The Rational Public: Fifty Years of Trends in Americans&amp;#039; Policy Preferences (American Politics and Political Economy Series)\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EbVJkmWRL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"105\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Rational Public\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">The Rational Public</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Rational Public\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">By Benjamin I Page and Robert Y Shapiro</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/rational-public-by-benjamin-i-page-and-robert-y-shapiro\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Tell me about <em>The Rational Public: 50 Years of Trends in Americans’ Policy Preferences.</em></p><p><em>The Rational Public</em> was written by two political scientists, Ben Page and Bob Shapiro. Bob Shapiro has the office next to mine in the political science department here at Columbia. The book came out in 1992 and they found something in public opinion that my colleagues and I had already noticed in elections, which is something we call “uniform partisan swing”. I don’t know how it is in other countries, but the basic idea is that Americans are spread out on some left-right scale, and we are, of course, quite diverse in our opinions. But when there is a change in opinion it tends to move everybody together. Not always, but generally. For example, gay rights are more popular than they used to be, amongst pretty much all groups. Or attitudes about economic issues – Americans are more economically conservative and more socially liberal than they used to be. Things tend to move at a national level.</p><p>Normally, when you have an election, it’s the same. Barack Obama is expected to get 4% to 5% less of the vote this election than last time. It’s roughly the same amount less in every state. Page and Shapiro looked at a whole bunch of issues and found that people were moving together.</p><p>They also found that people’s attitudes were rational, they made some sense. There have been findings in public opinion literature about something called “non-attitudes”, which is that sometimes you ask people a question and you come back and ask them later and they seem to have a completely different answer. But on issues that people have thought about, people have fairly sensible views. Often people have reasonable views that are not always conveyed that well, because they contradict a larger story. For example, voters tend to be consistently willing to cut certain aspects of the budget, including the military. But cutting the military is never very popular in Congress. That’s something you don’t always hear about. Americans support the military but they don’t support such a high military budget. It’s a very impressive book. They go through every issue and it’s quantitative – they have a lot of graphs – but they look at every issue seriously on its own terms.</p><p>So the public really is rational?</p><p>That’s what they say. The public can be manipulated, but generally they feel that people have fairly consistent views.</p><p>Why does this happen, people swinging on issues together, at a national level?</p><p>The ideological playing field is already laid out, so it varies. Sometimes an issue will become politicised. Take, for example, attitudes about climate change. That became very politicised – Democrats and Republicans moved in different directions. Most issues are already politicised. Once the politicisation has happened, once the issue has gone through that phase, then everybody tends to move together. You can even think about it in terms of attitudes to Obama. When he was elected, Democrats were very excited about him, and Republicans were sceptical. Independents wanted to give him a chance. Then, after some bad economic years, we have Republicans really detesting him, Independents not liking him – and Democrats not really liking him much either. The interesting thing is that a lot of Democrats say they don’t like Obama because they feel he’s not so liberal, he’s selling out, whereas a lot of Republicans don’t like Obama because they feel he’s an ideologue. I don’t buy either of those claims. What I think is happening is that fundamentally people aren’t liking Obama because they don’t think he’s performing well. They just have different storylines. The Republican storyline for someone who is a Democrat who they don’t like is that he’s an extreme liberal. The Democratic storyline for someone they don’t like is that he’s a weak sell-out. Even though it seems like they’re having opposite reactions, in reality it’s just the same reaction that’s being rationalised. It’s not that people are being irrational, it’s that the reason they give for their attitudes doesn’t always hold up. But the actual attitude is reasonable. Even if people get a lot of the facts wrong – and you can certainly do survey after survey, where you see people getting the facts wrong, and misunderstanding things – it is reasonable to say you’re less supportive of the president after some bad economic times.</p><p>Going back to what we discussed at the beginning, and this trend discussed in books like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X\"><em>What’s</em> <em>the</em> <em>Matter</em> <em>with</em> <em>Kansas</em>?</a> – you really don’t think it’s irrational to vote against your economic interests?</p><p>What’s <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/published/rational_final6.pdf\">rational in voting</a> is not about your own personal economic interests. The main outcome of the election is not what affects you, it’s what affects the entire country. So there’s a lot of evidence that people vote for what they think is good for the country. Of course, if you’re personally unemployed and know a lot of unemployed people, then it makes sense that you will feel that unemployment is a big issue. On the other hand, if you have money in the bank, people are still somehow concerned about inflation. What you consider important problems are certainly impacted by your experiences. But, no, I don’t think it’s a matter of your direct economic interests. I would say it’s indirect.</p><p>By the way, Bob Shapiro wrote an interesting paper in 2009 right after the last election where he <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2009/07/support_for_hea/\">talked about</a> all the problems Obama would have passing healthcare reform. He was right. Everybody thought it would be easy, but he recognised from looking at the survey data, that things in 2009 with Obama were very similar to what they were in 1993 with Bill Clinton. He’s a very clear-eyed observer. He should be the guy on the TV they ask about public opinion, not all these other bozos.</p><p>So here is one of the broader questions I wanted to put to you: Why is America so right wing? Take healthcare, which you just mentioned. Every other developed country in the world has universal healthcare. For wealthy countries, the idea that the government should either provide it or make sure it’s provided is completely uncontroversial. Why is the US different?</p><p>It’s hard to get from point A to point B. It would probably be hard to find many people who would argue that the American healthcare system is better than the French healthcare system, or even the Taiwanese healthcare system. What’s not obvious is how to get there. There are so many interests involved, so much money, so many companies. If they could somehow switch out the US system and switch in this other system – like they have in Taiwan or France – I think that would be wonderful. But it doesn’t seem that that’s considered an option. There are too many people who are doing fine from the current system. The argument made by the opponents of healthcare reform is that it would just be worse if you tried to get to that point from what we already have – we’d have the worst of both worlds. I don’t know if that’s true, but that’s my answer.</p><p>What about the right-wingness of America generally? When you go to America as a European, you begin to feel like Fidel Castro compared with the people around you. Everyone just seems further to the right on all sorts of issues. Do you have any insights into why that is?</p><p>I don’t have a good answer to that. People sometimes say it has to do with geographical divisions. In the United States the lower-income parts of the country tend to be more politically conservative. This happens in other countries too. The idea is that the richer places within a country – or even within a continent like Europe – tend to be more cosmopolitan, more socially liberal and lower-income places tend to be more traditional. Look at a country like Finland – it used to be one of the poorest places in Europe and now it’s one of the richest places. Being richer is associated with more of an open, liberal social attitude. Economics is more complicated. Traditionally, lower-income areas support more economic redistribution. In Europe, for example, the Greeks are lower income and more supportive of redistribution, and the Germans are in the opposite position.</p><p>In the US that was traditionally the case as well. But now the lower-income areas are less supportive of redistribution. This is one of the issues we explore in our book. We don’t have a complete story. Part of it is to do with racial politics. The South changed to the Republican Party, and there were changes that happened in the South – legal changes in the 1960s, where there was redistricting – and rural parts of the South got less representation and the cities and the suburbs got more representation. People from the cities and the suburbs tend to be more conservative on economic issues, and may be a better fit for the national Republican Party.</p><p>Another thing is that the Democratic Party is very reliant on various groups of rich people. Even to the extent that they’re liberal rich people, they’re not extremely liberal economically. They’re very much supportive of free markets. A Silicon Valley millionaire who supports Obama is looking for a Bill Clinton-style economic boom – he’s not looking for some sort of traditional socialist party.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50304\"><div><img title=\"Fire on the Prairie: Chicago&amp;#039;s Harold Washington and the Politics of Race\" alt=\"Image of Fire on the Prairie: Chicago&amp;#039;s Harold Washington and the Politics of Race\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61USIXmkOTL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"106\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"Fire on the Prairie\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">Fire on the Prairie</a></h2><p><a title=\"Fire on the Prairie\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">By Gary Rivlin</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/fire-prairie-by-gary-rivlin\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>You mentioned the politics of race. This is a big part of your next book, <em>Fire on the Prairie</em>, about Chicago’s first black mayor. Do you want to tell me a bit about it?</p><p>This is just an amazing story. It’s written by a journalist from Chicago who was clearly very sympathetic to Harold Washington, who was mayor of Chicago in the 1980s. He was an African-American, he’d been a member of Congress, and after the end of the old Daley machine in Chicago he ran for mayor. Actually there are several amazing stories. First that Chicago is a majority white city and he won the Democratic primary election and then the general election. He took advantage of divisions among his opponents. It was a very racist campaign. Washington was saying his opponents were corrupt and that they needed new leadership; his white opponents were saying that he couldn’t be trusted, that he was corrupt and that you should stick with what you have.</p><p>Then, after he became the mayor, there was just this amazing battle. The city council had 50 members and they were divided between supporters of Washington and supporters of his white opponents with a couple inbetween. Over the next couple of years, through a series of deals and elections, Washington and his allies ended up taking control of the council. It wasn’t just about winning the election, but this Stalingrad-type block-by-block battle afterwards. It’s just a very exciting story. And he won. You just don’t expect to see that. They managed to replace this alderman, then they managed to get this person to vote on their side, and eventually they twisted enough arms and did what they needed. Then Washington died of a heart attack.</p><p>It’s a fascinating book because it’s not only about the election but also about the political manoeuvrings. I’m an expert on public opinion and elections but I don’t really have much understanding of political manoeuvrings. In university politics I always managed to piss people off. This is a readable book, very fascinating, and then at the end when he dies, it’s very sad.</p><p>From the reviews I’ve read, it does seem like a bit of a potboiler.</p><p>It’s got good guys and bad guys, and unexpected twists. Washington was a very tough guy. It would have been very tempting for him to just have given up, and say, “Well, I did what I could.” But he didn’t.</p><p>In terms of the politics of race, what do we need to know about how race affects voting in the US?</p><p>At the national level, close to 90% of African-Americans vote for Democrats. For Obama it was about 96%. I think a lot of white people feel Democrats are the black party and don’t support them for that reason.</p><p>This is particularly in the Southern states?</p><p>Yes, though obviously it was also a big deal in Chicago. The assumption has always been that a black candidate could not win most of the white vote, so at first he was just not considered a serious candidate. It was just assumed that white people weren’t going to vote for this guy.</p><p>Were you incredibly surprised when Obama was elected?</p><p>No. He was in the lead, and the economy had not being doing well, so that meant the Democrat would do well. The stronger the partisan cues are, the less important other things are. People do argue about this. Some people claim – which may be true – that Obama maybe didn’t do as well as he would have done if he’d been white. He did about as well as predicted, based on the economy, but he outspent McCain. You could argue that Obama should have done a couple of percentage points better than forecast, because of the unequal campaign. It’s hard to say. People did some surveys where they claimed that some percentage of white people were less likely to vote for Obama because he was black. This kind of thing came up with Romney too. There were some people who said they wouldn’t vote for him because he’s a Mormon. People say all sorts of things in the abstract, but then when it comes to the election, they vote for him. I don’t really believe a lot of these things now, when people say “I won’t do x or y”. They won’t do it right up to the second they do it, and after they do it, they try to explain why it didn’t count.</p><p>These uniform partisan swings you mentioned, don’t they go against the whole notion of increasing partisanship in the US?</p><p>There is increasing partisanship, but it’s something that is happening gradually. Things that are happening in the timescale of a week or a month or a year, are pretty uniform. Long-term, though, the parties have been moving apart. Democrats are more and more distrustful of the Republicans and Republicans are more and more distrustful of the Democrats. So that is happening at the same time. You have the local uniform swings, within the context of the entire topography changing.</p></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><div><blockquote><div><div><div><div id=\"node-50305\"><div><img title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" alt=\"Image of The Emerging Republican Majority\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JYlXJQrLL._SL160_.jpg\" width=\"106\" height=\"160\" /></div><h2><a title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">The Emerging Republican Majority</a></h2><p><a title=\"The Emerging Republican Majority\" href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">By Kevin P Phillips</a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivebooks.com/recommended/emerging-republican-majority-by-kevin-p-phillips\">Buy</a></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><div><div><blockquote><p>We’ve got to your last book, <em>The Emerging Republican Majority</em>.</p><p>This is by Kevin Phillips. I don’t know his exact job title, but he worked for Richard Nixon. This was a classic book from 1969, about how American politics were changing. The idea was that, partly as a result of the Democrats becoming more uniformly liberal and having more support of blacks, Republicans would soon be able to get the support of various groups of white people, such as urban Catholics, who had traditionally been very strong Democrats. Richard Nixon could get political success, basically, by convincing a lot of white people – not the white people who are traditionally in charge of the country but so-called ethnic white people – that the Democrats were not on their side. Their pitch was that the Republicans were the only truly national party and the Democrats were a sectional party. The Democrats were representing interest groups and only Republicans were representing America. This was seemingly a very successful pitch, and it really mapped a new populism. It wasn’t a new argument. Nixon was making this argument back when he was Joe McCarthy’s buddy in the 1950s. Back then he was already arguing that the Democrats were a bunch of Communists and elitists, but the message didn’t catch on so well in the 1950s. Somehow it became more convincing around 1970 when the economy wasn’t going so well, and when there was a war in Vietnam and fighting in the streets.</p><p>In the last few years Phillips has written some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/American-Theocracy-Politics-Religion-Borrowed/dp/0143038281/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340073762&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=american+theocracy?tag=thebro-21\">very angry books</a>. He really detests George W Bush, basically arguing that the Republicans have been captured by a mixture of rich elites and extreme religious groups. If you look at a book like <em>The Emerging Republican Majority</em>, it’s not about the rich, it’s much more the idea that the Republicans are the sane middle of the country. He became a bit disturbed. This doesn’t discredit the Republicans, the fact that one of their operatives think they went too far. He’s just one guy. But it’s a very important book historically. It’s about a tactic that was actually followed successfully.</p><p>Does it have insights for the present?</p><p>It has insights in terms of how we got to where we are. Looking back, there was no reason to think the Republicans would become this alliance between some very religiously conservative people and these very economically conservative people. It was a different era of what was possible. Various industrialists at the time would have loved to have very low tax rates, but I don’t think it would have been considered possible. There have been big changes in American politics – big moves to the right on economic issues and to the left on social issues.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div><p>Update (2014):</p><p>I still wish I&#8217;d picked a title like Voting by the Numbers or The Secret Life of the American Voter.  &#8220;Red State Blue State&#8221; is catchy but I think it unfortunately gave people the impression that our book was a popularization of existing research rather than a treasure trove of original research itself.</p><p>Meanwhile, the patterns of income and voting within and between states have changed in some ways since the above discussion.

<div class=\"mt-post-excerpt-divider\"></div><p><strong>Three novels</strong></p><p><u>The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick</u>.  In this book, which takes place in a world in which the Allies lost World War II, hints keep peeking through that the world inhabited by the characters is not reality.  Our world is real, and the novel’s characters are living in a fake world (which is imperfectly perceived by the title character, who is thus so dangerous to those in power).  It’s a more complex twist on the theme of Man out of Joint, but ultimately the same idea:  the people in the novel are living in a fake world which can come apart around them as they recognize that it is a shared illusion.</p><p>Sort of like The Matrix in reverse.  It is a standard theme that our world is fake, there is an underlying truth, etc.  Dick turns this around.  (Actually, I’ve never seen The Matrix but this is what I’m imagining it’s about.)</p><p><u>Pavane by Keith Roberts</u>.  In this classic, the Catholics regained control of England in the 1500s, leading to a much different twentieth-century world.  The backstory, eventually revealed in the novel, is that the masters of our real world had seen the risks of nuclear weapons and had rerun history to give humankind an opportunity to develop without modern science and thus get some more time to figure things out before having to deal with potential species-ending warfare.</p><p><u>Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore</u>, which describes a United States in which the Confederates had won the battle of Gettysburg and then the Civil War.  In this one, the pattern of Pavane is reversed, sort of, in that the original world was the one described in most of the novel (the “alternative” history) but then, through some time-traveling mishaps, the story ends up in our reality.</p><p><strong>What does this all mean?</strong></p><p>Is there something we can learn from this, that the very best alternative history novels recognize our world as the real one?  I think so.  Alternate history could be said to have two purposes:  providing insight into our world, and escapism out of it (John Clute makes this point in the Science Fiction Encyclopedia, I believe).  By dividing it that way, I would seem to be damning “escapism” and praising “insight,” but that is not my point.  Rather, my point is that in either case, the thrill or interest comes from playing off the fact that our world is the real one.  An alternative history that does not recognize the reality of reality can simply “stack the deck” and in this sense is less interesting to me than a historical novel, or for that matter, than a pure science fiction novel (which, at some level, has to justify its choices).</p><p>In a sense, all novels are alternate histories, and the issue always arises whether they “couud have happened.”  Genre novels such as <em>Mystic River</em> or those of John Le Carre put in a lot of effort to place their stories within convincing backgrounds—and, in fact, creating these backgrounds is perhaps their main interest.</p><p>I’d also like to say something about the story “Forlesen” by Gene Wolfe, since it’s so cool, and it presents some sort of alternative history of 20th century America—but I’m not really sure what to say, so I won’t.</p><p><strong>Connections to statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science?</strong></p><p>Causal inference is about potential outcomes, what could have happened.  These potential outcomes should be realistic, and their “generative models” should be able to create reality as a reasonable probabilistic prediction.  (That’s just posterior predictive checking; see chapter 6 of our book.)

Maybe it’s interesting to discuss on your blog, especially since CIs are often promoted (for example in the new guidelines of<a href=\"http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/journals/psychological_science/ps-submissions\">Psychological Science</a>), but apparently researchers seem to have little idea how to interpret them. Given that the confidence percentage of a CI tells something about the procedure rather than about the data at hand, this might be understandable, but, according to us, it’s problematic nevertheless.</p></blockquote><p>I replied that I agree that conf intervals are overrated, a point I think I discussed briefly <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/pvalues3.pdf\">here</a>.

I offer some of it myself!  As I’ve written before (see <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/04/dan_goldsteins.html\">this post from 2008</a> reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2010/09/15/advice_that_mig/\">this post from 2010</a> reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.</p><p>It’s time to play the game again.  This time it’s advice from sociologist Fabio Rojas for Ph.D. students.  I’ll copy his eight points of advice, then, for each, evaluate whether I think it is positive or negative sum:<br /><span id=\"more-22734\"></span></p><blockquote><p>1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up.<br />
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride.<br />
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication. Don’t have the fantasy that you will magically get the job of your dreams sans publications. Time spent on other issues is “out of pocket” – do it because you care, not because it will help you.<br />
4. Hang out with winners. These people are actually pretty easy to identify – they do well in teaching and publication and they have a track record of placement. Also, ask around to see if people are nice. Where there is smoke, there’s fire.<br />
5. Be constructive. It is easy to criticize people, but it really doesn’t accomplish much. Instead, if you actually offer to help and present a solution, then you’ll make a difference and people will appreciate it.<br />
6. Say yes (unless it is a crazy person). In other words, join teams and accept projects, and say yes to grad school buddies. Once you get a few projects going, then you can say no.<br />
7. No excuses: the only thing that matters is task completion. It may be long or short, but everyday should involve a core task.<br />
8. Submit, submit, submit. Got rejected? No problem – just resubmit tomorrow. If you thought the reviewers were right, take a week and then resubmit. The key to success isn’t submission – it’s resubmission.</p></blockquote><p>OK, now the evaluation:</p><p>1. Probably positive sum.  If you don’t show up, this inconveniences others; whereas if you’re distracted and show up and do a crappy job, this still is likely to be better than people having to cover for you or reschedule the meeting.</p><p>2. Positive sum.  I’m assuming there are enough entry and exit points so you can modulate your effort to match the time and energy you have available.</p><p>3. Positive sum.  Information is good.  But I’d like to emphasize the last sentence of Rojas’s advice #3, and point out that, if you do something un-work-related because you care, that’s cool too.</p><p>4. At first this might sound negative-sum in that it would seem to promote a judgmental air (evaluating “winners” and thus, implicitly, “losers”), I actually think it’s positive sum, in that, to the extent more people follow this advice, it motivates potential collaborators and research supervisors to up their game.</p><p>Similarly, I generally recommend that students taking classes shop around and, to the extent possible, choose instructors with excellent teaching evaluations.  The signal isn’t perfect but it’s there (in my impression), and it also has generally positive effects in the sense of encouraging instructors to try harder and take their teaching more seriously.</p><p>5. This advice could be positive or negative sum, depending on how it’s taken.  If someone reads this advice and is encouraged to be constructive and help people, this is positive. But if someone reads this advice and is <em>discouraged</em> from offering frank criticism, I think it could be negative.  Criticism can be useful, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who doesn’t get enough of it!  I disagree with Rojas’s statement that criticism alone “really doesn’t accomplish much.”  It might not <em>seem</em> to be accomplishing much, but if you can save someone a year of effort by pointing out they’re on the wrong track, that can be a big deal!  Some of the biggest gains in life are the avoidances of big losses.</p><p>6. Positive sum.  Collaboration is good, and if it doesn’t work, it typically dissipates anyway.  I’ve seen so many students say they’re too busy to take on a new project, and what does it get them?  They’re just sitting in some room getting stuck on page 34 of some thesis that nobody will ever read anyway.</p><p>7. Mix of positive and negative sum. On one hand, everyone benefits when a task is completed.  On the other hand, we can all benefit from when we help each other understand things, so if people literally follow the advice that “the only thing that matters is task completion,” this could make like more difficult for everyone.</p><p>8. Negative sum, I’d say.  If everyone submits and publishes everything to refereed journals, this just overwhelms the system.

I offer some of it myself!  As I&#8217;ve written before (see <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/04/dan_goldsteins.html\">this post from 2008</a> reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2010/09/15/advice_that_mig/\">this post from 2010</a> reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.</p><p>It&#8217;s time to play the game again.  This time it&#8217;s advice from sociologist Fabio Rojas for Ph.D. students.  I&#8217;ll copy his eight points of advice, then, for each, evaluate whether I think it is positive or negative sum:<br /><span id=\"more-22734\"></span></p><blockquote><p>1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up.<br />
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride.<br />
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication. Don’t have the fantasy that you will magically get the job of your dreams sans publications. Time spent on other issues is “out of pocket” – do it because you care, not because it will help you.<br />
4. Hang out with winners. These people are actually pretty easy to identify – they do well in teaching and publication and they have a track record of placement. Also, ask around to see if people are nice. Where there is smoke, there’s fire.<br />
5. Be constructive. It is easy to criticize people, but it really doesn’t accomplish much. Instead, if you actually offer to help and present a solution, then you’ll make a difference and people will appreciate it.<br />
6. Say yes (unless it is a crazy person). In other words, join teams and accept projects, and say yes to grad school buddies. Once you get a few projects going, then you can say no.<br />
7. No excuses: the only thing that matters is task completion. It may be long or short, but everyday should involve a core task.<br />
8. Submit, submit, submit. Got rejected? No problem – just resubmit tomorrow. If you thought the reviewers were right, take a week and then resubmit. The key to success isn’t submission – it’s resubmission.</p></blockquote><p>OK, now the evaluation:</p><p>1. Probably positive sum.  If you don&#8217;t show up, this inconveniences others; whereas if you&#8217;re distracted and show up and do a crappy job, this still is likely to be better than people having to cover for you or reschedule the meeting.</p><p>2. Positive sum.  I&#8217;m assuming there are enough entry and exit points so you can modulate your effort to match the time and energy you have available.</p><p>3. Positive sum.  Information is good.  But I&#8217;d like to emphasize the last sentence of Rojas&#8217;s advice #3, and point out that, if you do something un-work-related because you care, that&#8217;s cool too.</p><p>4. At first this might sound negative-sum in that it would seem to promote a judgmental air (evaluating &#8220;winners&#8221; and thus, implicitly, &#8220;losers&#8221;), I actually think it&#8217;s positive sum, in that, to the extent more people follow this advice, it motivates potential collaborators and research supervisors to up their game.</p><p>Similarly, I generally recommend that students taking classes shop around and, to the extent possible, choose instructors with excellent teaching evaluations.  The signal isn&#8217;t perfect but it&#8217;s there (in my impression), and it also has generally positive effects in the sense of encouraging instructors to try harder and take their teaching more seriously.</p><p>5. This advice could be positive or negative sum, depending on how it&#8217;s taken.  If someone reads this advice and is encouraged to be constructive and help people, this is positive. But if someone reads this advice and is <em>discouraged</em> from offering frank criticism, I think it could be negative.  Criticism can be useful, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who doesn&#8217;t get enough of it!  I disagree with Rojas&#8217;s statement that criticism alone &#8220;really doesn’t accomplish much.&#8221;  It might not <em>seem</em> to be accomplishing much, but if you can save someone a year of effort by pointing out they&#8217;re on the wrong track, that can be a big deal!  Some of the biggest gains in life are the avoidances of big losses.</p><p>6. Positive sum.  Collaboration is good, and if it doesn&#8217;t work, it typically dissipates anyway.  I&#8217;ve seen so many students say they&#8217;re too busy to take on a new project, and what does it get them?  They&#8217;re just sitting in some room getting stuck on page 34 of some thesis that nobody will ever read anyway.</p><p>7. Mix of positive and negative sum. On one hand, everyone benefits when a task is completed.  On the other hand, we can all benefit from when we help each other understand things, so if people literally follow the advice that &#8220;the only thing that matters is task completion,&#8221; this could make like more difficult for everyone.</p><p>8. Negative sum, I&#8217;d say.  If everyone submits and publishes everything to refereed journals, this just overwhelms the system.  Yes, I realize that by publishing dozens of papers a year myself, I have an outsized &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; myself, so maybe I&#8217;m not one to talk. . . .</p><p>Ok, in sum, that&#8217;s 6 points on the positive side and 2 on the negative side.  Overall, the advice is positive sum.

Rather, I doubt that Brooks sees the connection at all.  I’m guessing that Brooks sees himself as a curious, questioning person, someone who does not follow orthodoxies of left and right but rather evaluates things on their own merits.

On one hand, he slams people who don’t admit how confused they are, or how shallow their knowledge is in certain areas.  On the other hand, he seems so unwilling to admit the areas where he is confused.</p><p>My resolution of the paradox has two parts:  politics and culture.<br />
First, politics.  Brooks is a conservative Republican in an industry (newspaper writing) that is dominated by liberal Democrats.  So it’s natural for him to interpret criticism as being ideological or political.  When Brooks mainstreams some false statistics on college admissions, and someone calls him on it, or when he gets sloppy in an article about red and blue America, and someone calls him on it, it’s natural for him to simply dismiss the criticism as being “intemperate” and to avoid looking at the substance of the issue.  The same thing happens to Paul Krugman, I’m sure.  Once you’re in the arena, it’s hard to evaluate criticism on its own grounds.</p><p>Second, culture. As various commenters <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/03/boldest-experiment-journalism-history-admit-made-mistake/#comment-156390\">discussed</a> in my recent blog on the topic, there do seem to be incentives for journalists and columnists to act omniscient.

I don’t envy the man.  To be in a situation in which even the most factual criticism is taken as political, and in which admitting error is something done only in extreme circumstances and not as a matter of course—that just seems sad.  I’m sure he gets paid a lot of money but I don’t think that’s why he’s doing it.  I think he’s just trapped in a cage and <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/01/03/booze-done/\">doesn’t even realize it</a>.  He’s internalized the values of his profession.
